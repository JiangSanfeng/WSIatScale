Cusset criticized this view as a form of ex post facto triumphalism. In technology, the 1990s saw the rise of cell phones and the internet.

apple	The ingredients for the modern mince pie can be traced to the return of European crusaders from the Holy Land. Middle Eastern methods of cooking, which sometimes combined meats, fruits and spices, were popular at the time. Pies were created from such mixtures of sweet and savoury foods ; in Tudor England, shrid pies ( as they were known then ) were formed from shredded meat, suet and dried fruit. The addition of spices such as cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg was, according to the English antiquary John Timbs, " in token of the offerings of the Eastern Magi. " Several authors, including Timbs, viewed the pie as being derived from an old Roman custom practised during Saturnalia, where Roman fathers in the Vatican were presented with sweetmeats. Early pies were much larger than those consumed today, and oblong shaped ; the jurist John Selden presumed that " the coffin of our " Christmas " - Pies, in shape long, is in Imitation of the Cratch [ Jesus's crib ] ", although writer T. F. Thistleton - Dyer thought Selden's explanation unlikely, as " in old English cookery books the crust of a pie is generally called'the coffin '. " The modern mince pie's precursor was known by several names. The antiquary John Brand claimed that in Elizabethan and Jacobean - era England they were known as minched pies, but other names include mutton pie, and starting in the following century, Christmas pie. Gervase Markham's 1615 recipe recommends taking " a leg of mutton ", and cutting " the best of the flesh from the bone ", before adding mutton suet, pepper, salt, cloves, mace, currants, raisins, prunes, dates and orange peel. He also suggested that beef or veal might be used in place of mutton. In the north of England, goose was used in the pie's filling, but more generally neat's tongue was also used ; a North American filling recipe published in 1854 includes chopped neat's tongue, beef suet, bloom raisins, currants, mace, cloves, nutmeg, brown sugar, @ @ apples @ @, lemons, brandy and orange peel.

Microsoft was shocked in 2005 by @ @ Apple @ @'s release of Mac OS X Tiger. It offered only a limited subset of features planned for Longhorn, in particular fast file searching and integrated graphics and sound processing, but appeared to have impressive reliability and performance compared to contemporary Longhorn builds. Most Longhorn builds had major Explorer. exe system leaks which prevented the OS from performing well, and added more confusion to the development teams in later builds with more and more code being developed which failed to reach stability.

Both types were enhanced by reducing the friction ; for screw and nut it is the recirculating ball mechanism, which is still found on trucks and utility vehicles.

The nut moves a sector of a gear, causing it to rotate about its axis as the screw is turned ; an @ @ arm @ @ attached to the axis of the sector moves the Pitman arm, which is connected to the steering linkage and thus steers the wheels. The recirculating ball version of this apparatus reduces the considerable friction by placing large ball bearings between the screw and the nut ; at either end of the apparatus the balls exit from between the two pieces into a channel internal to the box which connects them with the other end of the apparatus, thus they are " recirculated ".	slender stretch of inanimate object	mechanical arm	1981-3	division	branch	Any instrument or instrumentality used in fighting or hunting

arm	O'Sullivan opposed the coming of the American Civil War, hoping that a peaceful solution — or a peaceful separation of North and South — could be worked out. In Europe when the war began, O'Sullivan became an active supporter of the Confederate States of America ; he may have been on the Confederate payroll at some point. O'Sullivan wrote a number of pamphlets promoting the Confederate cause, arguing that the presidency had become too powerful and that states'rights needed to be protected against encroachment by the central government. Although he had earlier supported the " free soil " movement, he now defended the institution of slavery, writing that blacks and whites could not live together in harmony without it. His activities greatly disappointed some of his old friends, including Hawthorne. Towards the end of the Civil War, O'Sullivan appealed to his southern " comrades in @ @ arms @ @ " to burn Richmond, stating " let every man set fire to his own house ".	weapon	idiom	1981-1	weapon	weapon	A human limb; technically the part of the superior limb between the shoulder and the elbow but commonly used to refer to the whole superior limb

arm	At Long Binh Lt. Col. Martin Howell, the squadron commander, heard Keltner report small @ @ arms @ @ fire. Like the lieutenant, he believed it to be harassing fire but nevertheless dispatched the remainder of Troop C to the scene. With Troop C moving out of the staging area and the light fire team helicopters, alerted earlier, rushing to the scene, help was on the way even before the battle reached a peak. Although most of the front half of the convoy had passed out of danger, 8 trucks had fallen behind because the first of the 8 was carrying a heavy load. As these last trucks and the section led by the next two ACAVs, C18 and C13, entered the killing zone, the ACAV fired first into the edge of the jungle and, as they kept moving, into the banana grove. The VC answered with small arms and automatic weapons from both sides of the road. To many of the men in the following trucks, this fusillade was the first warning of an ambush, for vehicle noises had drowned out the earlier exchange. The trucks not yet under fire began to slow down, their drivers displaying the uncertainty they felt about what lay ahead. Yet the convoy kept moving and the road ahead remained clear. The exchange of fire grew in volume as those trucks with " shotgun " riders began to engage the ambushers on the right ( south ) side of the road. Then a round from a recoilless rifle struck C18 on the edge of the loading ramp but failed to stop the ACAV. As the firefight continued at close range, the trucks forming the rear of the column, not yet in the killing zone, began to pull over to the side of the road. Those immediately behind C18 and C13, already under fire, stopped and the men aboard raced for cover in ditches on either side of the road. The only vehicles moving at that point were the last eight trucks from the first half of the column and ACAV's C13 and C18.	weapon	weapon	1981-1	weapon	weapon	Any instrument or instrumentality used in fighting or hunting

arm	Another class with broad semantic extension is the " m - / mi - " class ( Bantu classes 3 / 4 ). This is often called the'tree'class, because " mti, miti " " tree ( s ) " is the prototypical example. However, it seems to cover vital entities neither human nor typical animals : trees and other plants, such as " mwitu "'forest'and " mtama "'millet'( and from there, things made from plants, like " mkeka "'mat') ; supernatural and natural forces, such as " mwezi "'moon ', " mlima "'mountain ', " mto "'river'; active things, such as " moto "'fire ', including active body parts ( " moyo "'heart ', " mkono "'hand, @ @ arm @ @') ; and human groups, which are vital but not themselves human, such as " mji "'village ', and, by analogy, " mzinga "'beehive / cannon '. From the central idea of " tree ", which is thin, tall, and spreading, comes an extension to other long or extended things or parts of things, such as " mwavuli "'umbrella ', " moshi "'smoke ', " msumari "'nail'; and from activity there even come active instantiations of verbs, such as " mfuo " " metal forging ", from " - fua " " to forge ", or " mlio " " a sound ", from " - lia " " to make a sound ". Words may be connected to their class by more than one metaphor. For example, " mkono " is an active body part, and " mto " is an active natural force, but they are also both long and thin. Things with a trajectory, such as " mpaka "'border'and " mwendo "'journey ', are classified with long thin things, as in many other languages with noun classes. This may be further extended to anything dealing with time, such as " mwaka "'year'and perhaps " mshahara "'wages '. Animals exceptional in some way and so not easily fitting in the other classes may be placed in this class.	limb	limb	1981-0	limb	limb	A human limb; technically the part of the superior limb between the shoulder and the elbow but commonly used to refer to the whole superior limb

Her photographs are taken from a classic straight - on frontal angle or seek a diagonal in the composition. She tends to shoot each actionless room from an elevated vantage point near one wall so that the far wall is centered within the resulting image. From her earliest creations, she has been interested in representing public spaces such as museums, libraries, national archives or opera houses devoid of all human presence. Höfer ’ s imagery has consistently focused on these depopulated interiors since the 1980s. Höfer groups her photographs into series that have institutional themes as well as geographical ones, but the formal similarity among her images is their dominant organizing principle.	financial institute	financial institute	3085-1	financial institute	financial institute	Sloping land (especially the slope beside a body of water)

Public installations of his sculpture have included works put on permanent display at Dublin Airport, Castlebar ( Co. Mayo ), Navan ( Co. Meath ), and Jordanstown ( Co. Antrim ). Of his own oeuvre Nolan said, " My works are a unity of painting and sculpture : spatial - colour - structure. It is of real space and colour, as opposed to illusory space. " Critic Cyril Barrett noted : " Since the mid - 1980s he has used strips of coloured paper for his reliefs. These reliefs are very varied and, with the play of light and shadow, that comes from the strip in relief, achieve a far greater richness and nuance of colour than colours on a plane surface. " Nolan had a lifelong passion for physics and astronomy ; two of his uncles, JJ Nolan and PJ Nolan, were prominent physicists. He also wrote an unpublished humorous play, in which Eratosthenes'ancient Greek quest to calculate the circumference of the Earth is placed in a Dublin context.	financial institute	financial institute	2950-0	financial institute	financial institute	Sloping land (especially the slope beside a body of water)

Section : : : : 2 : : : : History. It was commissioned by Nikolai's sons, Paul and Anatoly Nicolayevich Demidov, to honor his father, the Russian statesman, diplomat, and later Émigré to Florence, Nikolai Nikitich Demidov ( 1773 - 1828 ). The Count Demidoff had become a prominent patron, philanthropist, and businessman in Florence. The son Anatoly commissioned the design and statuary from the sculptor Lorenzo Bartolini. Bartolini worked on the monument from 1830 until his death in 1850. After his death, his pupil Pasquale Romanelli continued the monument till it was inaugurated in 1870. Initially the monument was planned for the Demidov's Villa San Donato, but Paul gifted it to the commune. Florence seeking to update itself as the capital of Italy, was expanding its public parks. The architect Giuseppe Poggi utilized the monument for this park that he had landscaped just south of the Palazzo Serristori. The Count Demidov had once resided in that Palace. The main statuary group shows Nikolai embracing his son, while " Gratitude " lies by their side. At the four corners are allegorical groups depicting : Mercy ; Siberia with the god Pluto ; the Muse of Festivals ; and the Truth as it revealed to Art. Demidov had made some of his fortune with Siberian mines. The child in the group at the Northwest corner has lost his marble arm. Below the statues a bas - relief depicts the death of Demidov. At the rear is the coat of arms of the family. Giuseppe Martelli designed the roof, which protects the statue.	ground along water	ground along water	3085-0	ground along water	ground along water	Sloping land (especially the slope beside a body of water)

The song is set in the key of C major and has a medium fast tempo – 128 beats per minute – with a piano range of C – G and a vocal range of E – G. Kelly is credited with both lyrics and music. The lyrics are written in the first person perspective, with the narrator, a female, reflecting on the violent nature of her relationship and broods over the Jekyll and Hyde transformation of her partner from being loving and attentive into a violent man. Typical of the'battered woman syndrome ', she adopts a victim's view claiming that it is her problem, and is happy to forgive the man after he ’ s bashed her.

bass	In the 1960s bands such as Orchestra Liberty began performing the antsa rhythm on modern drum kits with accompanying guitar or accordion replacing the traditional vocals. It was not until the 1970s that bands like Los Matadores and Les Players adapted the traditional vocal style to the newly electrified antsa. Guitar solos were inspired by the performance style of traditional Malagasy instruments like the valiha and marovany, combined with that of guitar solo work popularized in the Congo and Côte d'Ivoire. As a singer with Los Matadores, Jaojoby occasionally filled the instrumental breaks of rhythm and blues covers with improvised vocals inspired by the salegy tradition, to the jubilation of the young Malagasy listeners gathered outside the club's doors. Later, with The Players, Jaojoby and a handful of peers in northern urban areas experimented with incorporating vocals into the early instrumental salegy. Jaojoby described the adaptation of the traditional antsa style to modern instruments in the following terms : " The singing is that of the cattle herders moving their herds. The guitar imitates the great masters of the valiha. The keyboards provide the feeling of the traditional accordions, and the @ @ bass @ @ draws from the sound of the five traditional tuned drums. As far as the drum kit, well, it reproduces the ambiance of a Malagasy crowd on a day of celebration with all the hand clapping, shakers, and feet stomping the earth. " The salegy rhythm was adapted to the modern drum kit by Jean Claude Djaonarana, drummer of Los Matadores, who later rejoined Jaojoby's band from 1988 until his death in 1995.	guitar of low pitch	low pitched string instrument	2753-0	guitar of low pitch	low pitched string instrument	The lowest part of the musical range

bass	One benefit of the wOOx @ @ bass @ @ radiator ( and passive radiators in general ) when compared to the more common bass - reflex vents is that there is no possibility of air turbulence noise if the resonant system is greatly excited. As a result, additional equalization applied near the enclosure's tuning frequency can increase system output without generating extraneous noises or greatly increasing cone excursion of the active driver. Many wOOx - equipped mini - stereo systems produced by Philips feature a three - level equalization control which applies additional bass equalization at frequencies which excite the wOOx bass radiator, improving the visceral'impact'of the bass through the wOOx radiator's extreme air displacement capability. This use of active equalization to increase overall system output is the primary characteristic that differentiates wOOx technology from typical loudspeaker systems equipped with passive radiators.	low frequency sound	part of name	2753-4	low frequency sound	musical genre	The lowest part of the musical range

bass	 Epitaphium  began as a duet for two flutes, and can in fact be played as a flute duet, though the scoring was soon changed to flute and clarinet when Stravinsky learned that his piece was to share a program with Anton Webern's " Fünf geistliche Lieder ", Op. 15, which include those two instruments. Stravinsky began by composing a melodic - harmonic phrase purely by ear, and only in the midst of writing it saw the potential for a serial pattern, toward which he then turned his attention. The musical problem that first attracted him in the two - part counterpoint had to do with the harmonic use of minor seconds. Once he had completed the first little twelve - tone duet, Stravinsky hit on the idea of composing a series of funeral responses between treble and @ @ bass @ @ instruments. He chose the harp as bass instrument in order to achieve a muffled effect, and because he found the low notes the most beautiful on the instrument. The completed form is a sort of hymn, which Stravinsky likened to the " Funeral Music for Queen Mary " by Henry Purcell. There are four antiphonal strophes each in the harp and in the treble instruments, with each strophe containing one complete row statement : P, I, R, and RI in the harp, and P, RI, R, and I in the flute - clarinet duo. The resulting alternation of eight musical blocks dominates the form, though its force is counteracted by significant motivic connections among the blocks.	other musical instrument of low pitch	register	2753-3	other musical instrument of low pitch	basso	The lowest part of the musical range
bass	During these early years, DiFuria had enlisted friend and drummer Simon Nagle and bassist Gary Plowman to perform his songs with him. By late 1996, Plowman had left and Jeff Tanner had taken over, stabilizing the band as a live unit.

Its first full - length record appeared in 1998 on Darla Records, entitled " All Young in the Soul. " Like the earlier releases, the album featured a heavy late 1960s psychedelic influence, with noted off - kilter, " day - glo " overtones. The band was prolific over the next three years. 2000 witnessed two Photon Band releases on Darla : " Our ESP Driven Scene " collected the band ’ s singles, compilation tracks, and outtakes since their inception, and " Oh the Sweet Sweet Changes " featured new material in the vein of " All Young in the Soul, " but quieter.

It has a volcanic structure, is earth - like in size, and its temperature is almost 800 degrees even though it is very close to the Earth. There is also speculation in the world of science that billions of years ago Venus and Earth crashed, and it's out of this idea that Fazıl Say created a fantasy with his work. According to Say's fantasy, there was life on Venus that ended with a meteor shower, and the composition tells a story about those last minutes of life.

bass	To several reviewers, " Sacrifice " was flawed in its handling of combat. They found that the game's interface — which presented a viewpoint that looked over the wizard from behind — hindered them from having a clear picture of their characters'surroundings. The game's fast - paced combat ensured that fights tended to be messy affairs, where aside from picking out their units from a chaotic mass to issue commands, players had to see to their wizards'safety, and cast spells to support their army. Reviewers commented that once a player had lost a number of early battles, his or her army could never recover from its losses to win the match. " Sacrifice " s multiplayer games, as GameSpot's Sam Parker observed, tended to be long - drawn stalemates until the wizards obtained more powerful spells. " PC Zone " s Keith Pullin was disappointed that the game was not designed to reward tactics ; in his experience, he achieved victory by continually summoning groups of creatures to attack the enemy. @ @ Bass @ @ agreed that the game was lacking in tactical play, but other aspects impressed him enough to downplay this failing in his assessment.	surname	surname	7716-0	part of name	low pitched string instrument	The lowest part of the musical range

bass	Morbid Angel's style of music has undergone a number of changes throughout their musical career. The band's sound is characterised by harsh, growled vocals, technically complex guitarwork that frequently makes use of fast tremolo - picking and palm - muted riffs. Azagthoth's guitarwork is a core part of the band's sound, with his atonal " shredding " style being likened to the guitar work in Slayer. Pete Sandoval's work behind the drums has also been crucial to the band's sound, and " is known for his great double @ @ bass @ @ drum speed and technical proficiency " and as one of the fastest drummers in metal. In addition, " Sandoval is also among the first extreme metal drummers to champion the use of acoustic drum triggers. " On their early albums, they pushed metal to its most extreme level, musically and lyrically. The band has evolved their anti - Christian lyrical themes from these early works. On " Altars of Madness " the lyrics largely consist of simple blasphemous and overtly Satanic proclamations. However, the sophistication and depth of the lyrics has grown over time. On their 1993 album " Covenant ", the band articulate more broadly anti - theistic lyrics, and profess " anger at a higher power. " Today, " the band's lyrics are even more philosophical and thought - provoking. Current lyricist Trey Azagthoth has diagramed his personal ideology in the album " Formulas Fatal to the Flesh ". His stance is blasphemous and non - traditional, but hardly evil.

bass	Lithuanian folk music is based around songs ( " dainos " ), which include romantic, wedding songs, as well as work songs and more archaic war songs. Traditional vocal music is held in high esteem on a world scale : Lithuanian song fests and sutartinės multipart songs are on the UNESCO's representative list of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Folk songs were performed either in groups or alone, and in parallel chords or unison. Duophonic songs are common in the renowned sutartinės tradition of Aukštaitija. Another style of Lithuanian folk music is called rateliai, a kind of round dance. Instrumentation includes kanklės, a kind of zither that accompanies sutartines, rateliai, waltzes, quadrilles and polkas, and fiddles, ( including a @ @ bass @ @ fiddle called the " basetle " ), a kind of whistle called the " lumzdelis " and, similar in sound to clarinet, " birbyne " ; recent importations, beginning in the late 19th century, including the concertina, accordion and bandoneon.

bass	The six sonatas for violin and obbligato harpsichord BWV 1014 – 1019 by Johann Sebastian Bach are works in trio sonata form, with the two upper parts in the harpsichord and violin over a @ @ bass @ @ line supplied by the harpsichord and an optional viola da gamba. Unlike baroque sonatas for solo instrument and continuo, where the realisation of the figured bass was left to the discretion of the performer, the keyboard part in the sonatas was almost entirely specified by Bach. They were probably mostly composed during Bach's final years in Cöthen between 1720 and 1723, before he moved to Leipzig. The extant sources for the collection span the whole of Bach's period in Leipzig, during which time he continued to make changes to the score.	other musical instrument of low pitch	low pitched string instrument	2753-1	other musical instrument of low pitch	register	The lowest part of the musical range

" In his review of 2005's " Playing the Angel ", long after Wilder's departure from the band, " Rolling Stone " writer Gavin Edwards riffed upon Fletcher's statement with the opening line : " Depeche Mode's unique division of labor has been long established, with each of the three remaining members having a distinct role : Martin Gore writes the songs, Dave Gahan sings them and Andy Fletcher shows up for photo shoots and cashes the checks.

bass	The band formed in Annapolis, Maryland in 1964. Their original lineup consisted of Dave Vittek on lead vocals, Tom Curley on lead guitar and harmonica, Alan Fowler on @ @ bass @ @, and Richard Kumer on drums. They had been playing in local clubs for almost a year when they were discovered by Barry Seidel, who became their manager and brought them in to be the first act signed by his production company Traydel Productions. Seidel and his business partner Tony Traynor took the band to the recording studio to cut their first single " I Need Love " b / w a rock version of " Blowin'in the Wind. " " I Need Love " was later recorded by the Time Stoppers. Seidel and Traynor licensed the Mad Hatters'single to Ascot Records, a division of United Artists Records, who released it in the fall of 1965. " I Need Love " became a local hit in the Baltimore, Washington D. C. area and elsewhere, but it failed to break nationally. The Mad Hatters had recorded and a second single for Ascot, featuring two songs written by Tom Curley " This Is How It's Gonna Be " b / w " Go Find a Love, " but the label canceled the release after pressing promotional copies. The Mad Hatters signed with Fontana Records, who released their third single " I'll Come Running " b / w " Hello Girl " in late 1966. The record failed to catch on commercially. The band recorded a pair of pair of folk rock songs under the name the Loved ones, but they were never released. In early 1967, lead vocalist Dave Vittek left the group. For a while the Mad Hatters continued with Bobby Howard on lead vocals, but band had lost momentum and by the end of the year they broke up for.

bass	In 1934, Joseph @ @ Bass @ @ died and Charlotta Bass assumed control of the paper. The paper's coverage and focus during the 1940s has caused it to been credited as pioneering multi - ethnic politics, advocating Asian - American and Mexican - American civil rights. During this time period the " California Eagle ", along with other African - American presses, were under investigation by the Office of the Secretary of War, who viewed it as a threat to national security. The Department of Justice interrogated Bass in 1942 over claims that the paper was funded by Japan and Germany. The FBI continued to monitor Bass, as they deemed her actions as advocating the Communist Party despite a lack of evidence and Bass herself denying any assertions of the kind. In 1943, the Department of Justice was asked by the Post Office Department to revoke her mailing permit. The Post Office Department argued that the newspaper could not be mailed due to sensitive and illegal material within the paper. Bass again won the case, and the Department of Justice said her mailing permit would not be revoked.	surname	surname	7716-1	surname	surname	The lowest part of the musical range

bass	When in 1977 the construction of Interstate 55 detoured U. S. Route 66 in a gradual curve around the northwest side of Towanda, a 3 - 1 / 4 mile section of southbound Route 66 was closed off to motorized traffic and abandoned. Between 1998 and 2000, a not - for - profit student and community project created the Towanda Historic Route 66 Parkway, also known as the Historic Route 66 Trail ( as seen on Google Maps ), on a 2. 5 - mile stretch of the old disused Route 66 roadway between the south end of Towanda and a point about 3 miles northeast, where Interstate 55 swings east to meet up with and once again closely parallel Historic Route 66. The parkway, an ongoing project that preserved the Money Creek Bridge north of town on Route 66 and begins about 750 feet northeast of the bridge, also includes an outdoor educational exhibit on the history of Route 66 called " Historic Route 66 : A Geographic Journey " that details the path of Route 66 through all eight states. This exhibit extends from the intersection of Historic Route 66 and Jefferson Street near the I - 55 interchange to a point at the southern tip of town just past an unnamed pond off of Historic Route 66 ( at 40. 557656, - 88. 908876 ), where there is a rest stop and parking area for catfish and @ @ bass @ @ fishing in the pond. The stretch of the parkway where the exhibit was erected is a subset of the overall Towanda trail, which includes a three - flagpole garden on the NE corner of Jefferson and Route 66, several picnic areas along the length of the trail, scattered birdhouses and intermittent landscaped areas extending from the Money Creek Bridge to the south end of the pond. The trail and parkway exhibit, now a popular local tourist stop on Historic Route 66, continue to be improved on an irregular basis, and the progress of improvements is detailed on the project website.	fish	fish	2753-2	fish	fish	The lowest part of the musical range

In turn, the Commander in Chief, Pacific ( CINCPAC ) asked CNO what disposition was desired for " Inca ". CNO's response of 15 January, " above incorrect, " was probably the first clear indication received in the Pacific that the name and designation they had been using for this ship for the past five months were wrong. Back in early July 1945 the Navy had planned to take over another damaged Liberty ship, " Henry L. Abbott ", for self - propelled floating storage of lubricants and drummed petroleum products at Ulithi, and on 14 July SECNAV approved the name " Gamage " and designation IX - 227 for the ex - " Henry L. Abbott ". On 21 July, however, CNO wrote to the War Shipping Administration and asked that his request of 13 July for the " Henry L. Abbott " be canceled, because her poor hull condition made her unsuitable for use as dry cargo floating storage. CNO had already advised CINCPAC a day earlier of the cancellation of " Henry L. Abbott ". The Navy later decided to shift the name " Gamage " and the designation IX - 227 to the ex - " William B. Allison " and cancel the name and number given that ship on 6 August. This directive has not come to light in the archives, and the cryptic question sent to CINCPAC by CNO on 17 August, " Request information re acceptances " William B. Allison " for " Gamage " ( IX - 227 ) in lieu of " Henry L. Abbott " " appears to have gone unappreciated when CINCPAC on 24 August and again on 4 September reported the 30 July acceptance.

Each ship was designed by Romako to be larger with more powerful engines and carry a larger gun battery than their predecessors. Having encountered political opposition from the Austrian Reichsrat earlier in the year when he requested for additional funds, Ferdinand Max attempted to grow political support for the construction of future ironclads by purchasing some of the armor plating from a rolling mill in Celje owned by Reichsrat member Johann von Putzer. The Henckel von Donnersmarck Zeltweg works were likewise contracted to deliver armor plates for the ironclads, as were the same French firms which had provided the armor for the " Drache " class.

bow	Sadat took several measures to decentralize power to the provinces and towns. Governors acquired more authority under Law Number 43 of 1979, which reduced the administrative and budgetary controls of the central government over the provinces. The elected councils acquired, at least formally, the right to approve or disapprove the local budget. In an effort to reduce local demands on the central treasury, local government was given wider powers to raise local taxes. Local representative councils became vehicles of pressure for government spending, and the soaring deficits of local government bodies had to be covered by the central government. Local government was encouraged to enter into joint ventures with private investors, and these ventures stimulated an alliance between government officials and the local rich that paralleled the infitah alliance at the national level. Under Mubarak, decentralization and local autonomy became more of a reality, and local policies often reflected special local conditions.

In January 1916, the prime minister H. H. Asquith appointed a National Committee for the Care of Soldiers'Graves to take over this task. Edward, Prince of Wales agreed to serve as the committee's president. The committee's membership reflected all members of the British Commonwealth ( with a special representative from India ). Over the next year, members of the National Committee for the Care of Soldiers'Graves began to feel that their organization was inadequate to the task, and that a more formal organization, with a broader mandate, should be created. The idea was broached at the first Imperial War Conference in March 1917, and on 21 May 1917 the Imperial War Graves Commission ( IWGC ) was chartered.

The blueprints for the Moka Express are on display in the London Design Museum. Bialetti was probably heavily influenced by contemporary designers such as Hoffmann, Puiforcat, Genazzi and Henin ; to a certain extent he copied and built upon their coffee - pot designs. The coffee pot ’ s clean classic design with its symmetrical eight - faceted metallic body is easily recognisable — it followed the same design for over 70 years ( unusual in a world of constantly changing products ). Since its creation the Moka has become the world ’ s most famous coffee pot and has been cited in the Guinness Book of World Records as well as in various essential design books.

There he completed his well - known textbook of human anatomy, which went through some twenty editions and has been translated into several languages. The @ @ chair @ @ of anatomy at Vienna fell vacant in 1845. Satisfied with the opportunities for work at Prague, he would not have applied for the post but for the insistence of his friends. He was immediately elected. Five years later he published his " Handbook of Topographic Anatomy ", the first textbook of applied anatomy of its kind ever issued. Before his death he was to see this department of anatomy become one of the most important portions of the teaching in the medical schools of the world. It was as a teacher that Hyrtl did his great work. Professor Karl von Bardeleben, himself one of the great teachers of the nineteenth century, did not hesitate to say that in this Hyrtl was unequalled. His fame spread throughout Europe, and he came to be looked upon as the special glory of the University of Vienna. In 1858, he was visited by George Eliot and her partner. In her journal, she wrote : " Another great pleasure we had at Vienna — next after the sight of St. Stephen's and the pictures — was a visit to Hyrtl, the anatomist, who showed us some of his wonderful preparations, showing the vascular and nervous systems in the lungs, liver, kidneys, and intestinal canal of various animals. He told us the deeply interesting story of the loss of his fortune in the Vienna revolution of'48. He was compelled by the revolutionists to attend on the wounded for three days'running. When at last he came to his house to change his clothes he found nothing but four bare [ 40 ] walls! His fortune in Government bonds was burned along with the house, as well as all his precious collection of anatomical preparations, etc. He told us that since that great shock his nerves have been so susceptible that he sheds tears at the most trifling events, and has a depression of spirits which often keeps him silent for days.

However, there is no evidence that this practice dated back any earlier.

The interim Prime Minister has an obligation to explain in person to the Forum Leaders as to why he could not fulfill those commitments, and we were all looking forward to his doing this at this Forum in Niue. That he chose not to do this is most unfortunate and most disappointing. In May 2009, however, Sevele questioned the purpose of Fiji's suspension from the Forum ( which had taken place on May 2 ) and suggested it was " pointless " to " ostracise " Fiji. TVNZ described Tonga's position as " a crack [... ] in the hard line being taken against Fiji " by the Forum.	person in charge	person in charge	7507-0	person in charge	person in charge	The officer who presides at the meetings of an organization

The new PM appointed Brokenshire as Parliamentary Under - Secretary of State for Crime Reduction in the Home Office. One of his first moves was to initiate the closing of the United Kingdom's Forensic Science Service ; it had been making operational losses of £2 million a month, and was predicted to go into administration in early 2011. Brokenshire stated his desire that there would be " no continuing state interest in a forensics provider by March 2012 ", with the service's role being taken on by private enterprise.

Neither this photo nor footage provided by a Czech TV station conclusively support Tipsarević's version of the events.

The investigations continued into 2006, with the committee tracing Abramoff's activities across six tribes and states. McCain spoke harshly of Abramoff : " What sets this tale apart, what makes it truly extraordinary, is the extent and degree of the apparent exploitation and deceit.

In response to this and other developments regarding Indian gaming, by 2005 and 2006 McCain was pushing for amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that would limit creation of off - reservation casinos by Indian tribes as well as limiting the movement of tribes across state borders. After McCain lost his chair position following Democrats regaining the Senate in 2007, he continued to introduce a number of Indian affairs - related legislation ; overall, he had had more effect on the development of laws regarding Indian casinos than any other member of Congress.	person in charge	person in charge	2643-0	person in charge	person in charge	A seat for one person, with a support for the back

In 1975, Piloni moved to Serie B side Pescara, helping the club to obtain Serie A promotion in 1977 for the first time in their history, and making a name for himself as an experienced and reliable goalkeeper. In 1978, following Pescara's relegation, he moved to Rimini for two seasons.

Their cattle ranch near the confluence of the Bonaparte and Thompson Rivers was named for Cornwall's birthplace as Ashcroft Manor ; the township as Ashcroft. The ranch also operated a gristmill, a sawmill, and a roadhouse. Both Cornwalls were avid proponents of " gentlemen's sports ", especially horse - racing and fox - hunting. The Ashcroft Manor Ranch was memorable for its hunting parties, with Cornwall's select group of foxhounds, from the Duke of Beaufort's celebrated kennels, put in hot pursuit of the local coyotes instead of foxes, and lavish social entertainments for any guests visiting during the hunt. Ashcroft became one of the main horse - racing venues in the province at a time when that was the number - one sport, and Cornwall took a prominent part in their organization.

crane	The first name of the female protagonist was changed from Mary to Marion because a real Mary @ @ Crane @ @ existed in Phoenix. Also changed is the novel's budding romance between Sam and Lila. Hitchcock preferred to focus the audience's attention on the solution to the mystery, and Stefano thought such a relationship would make Sam Loomis seem cheap. Instead of having Sam explain Norman's pathology to Lila, the film uses a psychiatrist. ( Stefano was in therapy dealing with his relationship with his own mother while writing the script. ) The novel is more violent than the film ; for instance, Marion is beheaded in the shower as opposed to being stabbed to death. Minor changes include changing Marion's telltale earring found after her death to a scrap of paper that failed to flush down the toilet. This provided some shock effect because toilets almost never were seen in American cinema in the 1960s. The location of Arbogast's death was moved from the foyer to the stairwell. Stefano thought this would make it easier to conceal the truth about " Mother " without tipping that something was being hidden.

Surrounding towns and villages were often mistaken for Barrow and were attacked instead, while many streets in Barrow were severely damaged. Bombing during mid - April 1941 caused significant damage to a central portion of Abbey Road, completely destroying the Waverley Hotel as well as Christ Church and the Abbey Road Baptist Church. The town's main public baths and Essoldo Theatre were also severely damaged, however they were repaired within years. Hawcoat Lane is a street that is most noted for taking a direct destructive hit in early May 1941. Barrow has been described as somewhat unprepared for the Blitz, as there were only enough public shelters for 5 percent of the town's population ; some people who lived in the town centre were even forced to seek refuge in hedgerows on the outskirts of Barrow.

crane	 The Simpsons  creator Matt Groening appears in a cameo as the court illustrator in the Quimby trial. He can be seen signing his name on his sketch. During the trial, Bart quips " the system works. Just ask Claus von Bulow ". This is a reference to the British socialite who was accused of attempted murder, but was acquitted after two trials. Of the twelve jury members, Homer is the only one to vote " innocent ", angering the other eleven jurors ; the trial ends with Freddy being found innocent. This is a reference to the film " 12 Angry Men ". During the trial, Homer sings the jingle of the cat food company Meow Mix in his head.

crane	One of the reasons that the van was less popular with fleet operators than the Bedford and Ford Transit models it sold against was that, as on the BMC J2 and J4 models the forward - control design restricted access to the engine and made engine changes labour - intensive ; the only way to remove the engine without dropping the suspension subframe was to remove the windscreen and @ @ crane @ @ the engine out through the passenger door. A 1974 road test of a motor caravan version fitted with the 1725cc engine reported a maximum speed of and a 0 – 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) time of 25 seconds, indicating a higher top speed but, in this form, slower acceleration than the BMC competitor. However, the testers reported that at the van was " plainly at its absolute limit, screaming away in a most distressing fashion " ; readers were advised to view as a more realistic absolute maximum. Reportedly, one condition of the government bailout of Chrysler's British operations in 1976 was a commitment to upgrade the Spacevan, which was praised for its brakes, cornering, and price, but criticized for its power, comforts, and top speed. A revised Spacevan was thus introduced in 1977, using the same mechanicals but with numerous cosmetic changes, conveniences, and a new interior. Although outdated by its demise in 1982, by which time Commer had been taken over by Peugeot, the Spacevan remained a familiar sight in the UK thanks to its role with Post Office Telephones — which was almost solely responsible for it remaining in production for so long and these vans and outstanding orders were inherited by British Telecom on its formation in October 1981. By this time, there were three engines : two 1. 7 L petrol engines of 37 kW ( with low compression ) and 42 kW ( with high compression ), and a small diesel engine ( 31 kW ), with a four - speed manual transmission and no automatic available. The last Spacevan was built in 1983.	machinery for lifting heavy objects	machinery for lifting heavy objects	22386-0	machinery for lifting heavy objects	machinery for lifting heavy objects	Couldn't match sense

Two stages were used to construct the colony on LV - 426, using miniature models that were, on average, six feet tall and three feet wide. Filming the miniatures was difficult because of the weather ; the wind would blow over the props ; however, it proved helpful to give the effect of weather on the planet. Cameron used these miniatures and several effects to make scenes look larger than they really were, including rear projection, mirrors, beam splitters, camera splits and foreground miniatures. Due to budget limits, Cameron said he had to pay for the robotic arm used to cut into Ripley's shuttle in the opening scene. Practical effects supervisor John Richardson ( who won a special effects Oscar for his part in the film ) declared his biggest challenge was creating the forklift power - loader exoskeletons, which required only three months of work and had Cameron complaining about visual details during construction.

crane	@ @ Crane @ @ began writing " The Monster " in June 1897 while living in Oxted, England with his longtime partner Cora Taylor. Despite his previous success — " The Red Badge of Courage " had gone through 14 printings in the United States and six in England — Crane was running out of money. To survive financially, he worked at a feverish pitch, writing prolifically for both the English and the American markets. He later remarked that he wrote " The Monster " " under the spur of great need ", as he desperately required funds. In August of that year, Crane and Cora were injured in a carriage accident while visiting friend Harold Frederic and his mistress Kate Lyon in Homefield, Kenley ; after a week of recuperation, they followed the couple on vacation to Ireland, where Crane finished the story. " The Monster " was Crane's first story to feature the fictional town of Whilomville ; it would eventually serve as the setting of 14 stories, 13 of which would appear in the 1900 anthology " Whilomville Stories ". The town was based on Port Jervis, New York, where the author lived from the age of six to eleven. Although Crane and his mother relocated to Asbury Park, New Jersey in 1880, until 1896 he frequently stayed with his older brother and Port Jervis resident William Howe Crane. Crane admitted to his publishers that while he readily used Port Jervis as inspiration while writing " The Monster ", he was anxious to ensure that the residents of his previous hometown did not recognize themselves in the fictional Whilomville. While Crane biographer Thomas Beer claimed to trace the prototype of Henry Johnson to a Port Jervis teamster named Levi Hume, Crane's niece, Edna Crane Sidbury, believed the character and his disfigurement were influenced by a local waste collector whose face was damaged by cancer. In " Black Frankenstein : The Making of an American Metaphor ", author Elizabeth Young theorized that Crane may also have been inspired by popular freak show attractions such as Zip the Pinhead, whose real name was William Henry Johnson, and Joseph Merrick, the Elephant Man. It is also possible that Crane found thematic inspiration in Henrik Ibsen's " An Enemy of the People " ; although first published in 1882, the play — about a physician who finds himself ostracized by his community — first became popular in the United States in the mid - 1890s.	surname	surname	15972-0	surname	surname	Couldn't match sense

crane	In the late 1960s and early 1970s, preparations were being made to establish a civic centre complex on the land to the north of the park. A larger area was required than was available there, and it was decided that a school reserve on the adjoining block should be utilised and the section of Nelson Street separating them closed off. The council proceeded with this plan, also acquiring most of the freehold properties on the adjacent block. By 1973, construction of the first stage of the civic centre project, an Administration Building, was underway. In order to make way for this building, the WWI memorial had to be relocated for a second time and was moved to the opposite end of Jubilee Park close to Alfred Street, again on axis with the band rotunda. This time, moving the base of the monument proved very difficult because of its concrete fill added during the 1945 relocation, which had attached it too firmly to the solid foundation. The column was lifted off, but despite a concerted effort with the city's largest @ @ crane @ @, wedges and jacks, the base could not be moved. To avoid damaging the monument, a series of holes had to be drilled through the concrete base to weaken its hold on the foundations. ]	machinery for lifting heavy objects	machinery for lifting heavy objects	22386-0	machinery for lifting heavy objects	machinery for lifting heavy objects	Lifts and moves heavy objects; lifting tackle is suspended from a pivoted boom that rotates around a vertical axis

Méliès created the film's special effects using a wide array of techniques, including stage machinery, pyrotechnics, scenery rolling horizontally and vertically, miniature models, real water, substitution splices, and superimpositions. The Giant of the Snows was a gigantic marionette which required twelve men to operate.

In 1877, he built the first screw propelled steam trawler in the world. This vessel was " Pioneer LH854 ". She was of wooden construction with two masts and carried a gaff rigged main and mizen using booms, and a single foresail. " Pioneer " is mentioned in " The Shetland Times " of 4 May 1877. In 1878 he completed " Forward " and " Onward ", steam - powered trawlers for sale. Allan argued that his motivation for steam power was to increase the safety of fishermen. However local fishermen saw power trawling as a threat. Allan built a total of ten boats at Leith between 1877 and 1881. Twenty - one boats were completed at Granton, his last vessel being " Degrave " in 1886. Most of these were sold to foreign owners in France, Belgium, Spain and the West Indies. The first steam boats were made of wood, but steel hulls were soon introduced and were divided into watertight compartments. They were well designed for the crew with a large building that contained the wheelhouse and the deckhouse. The boats built in the 20th century only had a mizzen sail, which was used to help steady the boat when its nets were out. The main function of the mast was now as a crane for lifting the catch ashore. It also had a steam capstan on the foredeck near the mast for hauling nets.

deck	One problem which immediately surfaced was the poor @ @ deck @ @ behaviour of this mark, especially on take - off. At full power the slipstream of the propeller, which swung to the left ( as opposed to the Merlin, which swung to the right ), often forced the Seafire to swing to starboard, even with the rudder hard over on opposite lock. This sometimes led to a collision with the carrier's island. The undercarriage oleo legs were still the same of those of the much lighter Merlin engined Spitfires, meaning that the swing was often accompanied by a series of hops. As an interim measure it was recommended that pilots avoid using full power on take - off ( + 10 lb " boost " maximum was recommended ). There were also problems involved with this swing being strongly accentuated in the event of an asymmetric firing of the RATOG equipment. In the event, none of the " first generation " Griffon - engine Seafires were to use RATOG at sea unless they were ranged forward of the first crash barrier on deck.	ship deck	ship deck	5579-0	ship deck	ship deck	Any of various platforms built into a vessel

deck	Dressing into a dry suit is usually more time - consuming than a wet suit, and may require the assistance of another person to check the neck seal and close the zipper. In situations where the air is warm but the water cold, a prolonged time on the @ @ deck @ @ of a boat donning a dry suit and other gear can present a risk of overheating to the diver. This is a particular problem to relatively inexperienced divers, who may require more time to dress in. This problem can be mitigated by preparing all other equipment as far as possible before fully donning the suit and to wet the outside of the suit, and the hair and face after closing the zipper, to provide some evaporative cooling while on deck. Professional stand - by divers may have a similar problem, as they are required to be ready for deployment at all times while the working diver is in the water, which may involve waiting on deck for several hours. Wetting the outside of the suit, and seating the diver in shade and a breeze, are the usual solutions to this problem. Overheating in the suit can also happen when there is a difficult route to the water for a shore dive. A side effect of overheating is that the sweat produced by the diver can wet the thermal undergarment or condense on the inside of the suit, reducing the insulating qualities during the dive.	ship deck	ship deck	5579-0	ship deck	ship deck	Any of various platforms built into a vessel

In June 2015, this was also expanded to include a white area featuring the last name of the current batter and their performance throughout the game ( or their average for their first time at - bat ). When a home run is hit, the main box turns to the team's color and displays the text " Home Run ", while the dynamic strip grows and displays the name of the team over the team's logo. Other times ( usually on FSN ), the dynamic strip displays the name of the player who hit that home run and the main box displays the type of home run and how many home runs that player has hit during the season.

Defeating many colorful teams along the way, both Hiroki's and Teru's teams advance to the finals, which are to be held the next day. However, the night before the tournament finals, Maria gets hit by a car and is hospitalized as a result. With no one else to turn to, Daigo asks Shigehiro to be Maria's replacement, but he refuses due to his work. The next day, despite Hiroki not believing his father would come, Shigehiro does in fact make it in time before Hiroki's team gets disqualified. The finals begin with Shigehiro using his deceased wife Kumiko's @ @ deck @ @ against one of Teru's team members. Although Shigehiro ends up losing, he remembers the last conversation he had with Kumiko before she died. After the fight, he apologizes to Hiroki for all the mean things he said and gives him Kumiko's necklace, telling him to have courage. With Teru's team leading 1 – 0, the next fight between Daigo and Eiji starts. Despite Eiji's genius - level play, Daigo refuses to give up. He miraculously defeats Eiji, who runs away crying. With the score now 1 - 1, it comes down to the last match between Hiroki and Teru. Although Hiroki tries his absolute best and never gives up, Teru ultimately wins. Hiroki, Shigehiro, and Daigo all cry in frustration, but during the awards ceremony, Teru recognizes Hiroki and gives him his respect and friendship. Afterwards, when Daigo goes to the hospital to give flowers to the injured Maria, he sees her with another man, assuming that he is Maria's significant other. Believing that his love for Maria is over before it started, he runs off. In the end, Hiroki is now more confident in himself and has many friends. Daigo decides to go back to being a wanderer, but not before he and Hiroki have one last cardfight.	pack	deck of cards	5579-3	pack	deck of cards	Any of various platforms built into a vessel

The steamship fight in the prologue's 1938 portion was filmed in three days on a sixty - by - forty - feet @ @ deck @ @ built on gimbals at Elstree. A dozen dump tanks — each holding three hundred imperial gallons ( 360 U. S. gallons ; 3000 lb. ) of water — were used in the scene. Henry's house was filmed at Mill Hill, London. Indiana and Kazim's fight in Venice in front of a ship's propeller was filmed in a water tank at Elstree. Spielberg used a long focus lens to make it appear the actors were closer to the propeller than they really were. Two days later, on August 4, another portion of the boat chase using Hacker Craft sport boats, was filmed at Tilbury Docks in Essex. The shot of the boats passing between two ships was achieved by first cabling the ships off so they would be safe. The ships were moved together while the boats passed between, close enough that one of the boats scraped the sides of the ships. An empty speedboat containing dummies was launched from a floating platform between the ships amid fire and smoke that helped obscure the platform. The stunt was performed twice because the boat landed too short of the camera in the first attempt. The following day, filming in England wrapped at the Royal Masonic School in Rickmansworth, which doubled for Indiana's college ( as it had in " Raiders of the Lost Ark " ). Shooting in Venice took place on August 8. For scenes such as Indiana and Brody greeting Elsa, shots of the boat chase, and Kazim telling Indiana where his father is, Robert Watts gained control of the Grand Canal from 7 am to 1 pm, sealing off tourists for as long as possible. Cinematographer Douglas Slocombe positioned the camera to ensure no satellite dishes would be visible. San Barnaba di Venezia served as the library's exterior. The next day, filming moved to the ancient city of Petra, Jordan, where Al Khazneh ( The Treasury ) stood in for the temple housing the Grail. The cast and crew became guests of King Hussein and Queen Noor. The Treasury had previously appeared in " Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger ". The main cast completed their scenes that week, after 63 days of filming.	ship deck	flat floored roofless area	5579-0	ship deck	ship deck	Any of various platforms built into a vessel

digit	Working memory is widely acknowledged as having limited capacity. An early quantification of the capacity limit associated with short - term memory was the " magical number seven " suggested by Miller in 1956. He claimed that the information - processing capacity of young adults is around seven elements, which he called " chunks ", regardless of whether the elements are @ @ digits @ @, letters, words, or other units. Later research revealed this number depends on the category of chunks used ( e. g., span may be around seven for digits, six for letters, and five for words ), and even on features of the chunks within a category. For instance, span is lower for long than short words. In general, memory span for verbal contents ( digits, letters, words, etc. ) depends on the phonological complexity of the content ( i. e., the number of phonemes, the number of syllables ), and on the lexical status of the contents ( whether the contents are words known to the person or not ). Several other factors affect a person's measured span, and therefore it is difficult to pin down the capacity of short - term or working memory to a number of chunks. Nonetheless, Cowan proposed that working memory has a capacity of about four chunks in young adults ( and fewer in children and old adults ).	numeric character	numeric character	16521-0	numeric character	numeric character	A digit from 0 to 9 in decimal notation

Modern IBM mainframes use four hexidecimal digits as an arbitrary subchannel number within a channel subsystem subset, whose definition includes the actual channels, control units and device, providing addressing for up to 65, 536 DASD per channel subsytem subset. In practice, physical and design constraints of the channel and of the controllers limited the maximum number of attached DASD attachable to a system to a smaller amount than the number that could be addressed.	numeric character	numeric character	16521-0	numeric character	numeric character	A digit from 0 to 9 in decimal notation

These areas had used 4 - 1 - 1 for directory assistance, and because of the ability of common - control switching to analyze the initial @ @ digits @ @ of a number in a " sender " before routing the call, these areas did not require the dialing of an initial " 1 " to initiate a long - distance call. There was no ambiguity, because the initial assignment of area codes always used either a " 0 " or a " 1 " as the second digit, and the second digit of local numbers was never a " 0 " or a " 1 " because of the use of two - letter plus 5 - digit local numbering, with the letters only on digits 2 - 9 of the dial.	numeric character	numeric character	16521-0	numeric character	numeric character	One of the elements that collectively form a system of numeration

digit	The number 0 is created by codice _ 12, where codice _ 13 is the empty array and codice _ 6 is the unary plus, used to convert the right side to a numeric value ( zero here ). The number 1 is formed as codice _ 15 or codice _ 16, where the boolean value codice _ 17 ( expressed as codice _ 18 or codice _ 19 in JSFuck ) is converted into the numeric value 1 by the prepended plus sign. The @ @ digits @ @ 2 to 9 are formed by summing codice _ 17 the appropriate number of times. E. g. in JavaScript codice _ 21 = 2 and codice _ 17 = codice _ 18 = codice _ 19, hence 2 can be written as codice _ 25 or codice _ 26. Other digits follow a similar pattern. Integers consisting of two or more digits are written, as a string, by concatenating 1 - digit arrays with the plus operator. For example, the string codice _ 27 can be expressed in JavaScript as codice _ 28. By replacing the digits with the respective JSFuck expansions, this yields codice _ 29. To get a numeric value instead of a string, one would enclose the previous expression in parentheses or square brackets and prepend a plus, yielding codice _ 30 = codice _ 31.	numeric character	numeric character	16521-0	numeric character	numeric character	A digit from 0 to 9 in decimal notation

digit	The arms of " I. bernissartensis " were long ( up to 75 % the length of the legs ) and robust, with rather inflexible hands built so that the three central fingers could bear weight. The thumbs were conical spikes that stuck out away from the three main @ @ digits @ @. In early restorations, the spike was placed on the animal's nose. Later fossils revealed the true nature of the thumb spikes, although their exact function is still debated. They could have been used for defense, or for foraging for food. The little finger was elongated and dextrous, and could have been used to manipulate objects. The phalangeal formula is 2 - 3 - 3 - 2 - 4, meaning that the innermost finger ( phalange ) has two bones, the next has three, etc. The legs were powerful, but not built for running, and each foot had three toes. The backbone and tail were supported and stiffened by ossified tendons, which were tendons that turned to bone during life ( these rod - like bones are usually omitted from skeletal mounts and drawings ).	finger	finger	16521-2	finger	finger	A finger or toe in human beings or corresponding body part in other vertebrates

Embolomeri ) the intercentrum and pleurocentrum may be of equal size, while in the vertebrae of seymouriamorphs the pleurocentrum is the dominant element and the intercentrum is reduced to a small wedge. The intercentrum gets further reduced in the vertebrae of amniotes, where it becomes a thin plate or disappears altogether. Unlike most labyrinthodonts, the body was moderately deep rather than flat, and the limbs were well - developed and ossified, indicating a predominantly terrestrial lifestyle except in secondarily aquatic groups. Each foot held 5 @ @ digits @ @, the pattern seen in their amniote descendants. They did, however, lack the reptilian type of ankle bone that would have allowed the use of the feet as levers for propulsion rather than as holdfasts.	finger	finger	16521-2	finger	finger	A finger or toe in human beings or corresponding body part in other vertebrates

When adult, males measure 22. 9 to 25. 5 millimeters, females - 26. 4 to 28. 0 millimeters, both with the head longer than wide, straight canthus, sunken lore, medium - sized, almost round tympanum, and side - directed nostril openings. Males additionally possess two lateral vocal sacs, which can distend to a great extent. The fore limbs are slender, and the hind limbs are robust. Several tubercles are present on them. The @ @ digits @ @ bear lateral fringes, more extensive on the toes than on the fingers, and more pronounced in males than females, as well as weakly developed scutes. The fingertips are small and almost in the shape of an ellipse ; the toes end in nearly round discs. The thumbs don't possess any significant features. The frog's skin is mostly smooth, with some regions slightly textured. Although " Hylodes japi " is mostly silver in color, its body features dark spots and blotches, light, lateral stripes, and brown to chestnut bars. In preservative, the colors become less vivid.

digit	Artificial Intelligence : As indicated above AI depends on vast quantities of verified data, most of which is rightly considered private for personal or commercial reasons. This leads to a catch - 22 resulting from inadvertent entry of seemingly innocuous or protected data to otherwise secure websites. Thus using dozens of " right of access " requests, Oxford - based researcher James Pavur found that he could access personal information — ranging from purchase histories, to credit card @ @ digits @ @, to past and present home addresses — from several UK and US - based companies without even verifying his identity. In commercial fields various ploys to accumulate data useful for AI are ubiquitous. Access to high - quality training data is critical for startups that use machine learning as the core technology of their business. According to Moritz Mueller - Freitag, " While many algorithms and software tools are open sourced and shared across the research community, good datasets are usually proprietary and hard to build. Owning a large, domain - specific dataset can therefore become a significant source of competitive advantage. " User input even includes such innocuous user interfaces that encourage users to correct errors, such as Mapillary and reCAPTCHA. Thus the web user is groomed progressively to cooperate in the construction of AI in exchange for access to unverifiable information, whilst his rights are extinguished by agreeing to unfathomable terms and conditions.	numeric character	numeric character	16521-0	numeric character	numeric character	A digit from 0 to 9 in decimal notation

digit	Ternary numbers can be used to convey self – similar structures like the Sierpinski triangle or the Cantor set conveniently. Additionally, it turns out that the ternary representation is useful for defining the Cantor set and related point sets, because of the way the Cantor set is constructed. The Cantor set consists of the points from 0 to 1 that have a ternary expression that does not contain any instance of the @ @ digit @ @ 1. Any terminating expansion in the ternary system is equivalent to the expression that is identical up to the term preceding the last non - zero term followed by the term one less than the last nonzero term of the first expression, followed by an infinite tail of twos. For example : 0. 1020 is equivalent to 0. 1012222... because the expansions are the same until the " two " of the first expression, the two was decremented in the second expansion, and trailing zeros were replaced with trailing twos in the second expression.	numeric character	numeric character	16521-0	numeric character	numeric character	A digit from 0 to 9 in decimal notation

It encodes the outward part of the postcode in a way that is useful for mail routing, so that a particular range of Mailsort codes goes on a particular plane or lorry. Mailsort users are supplied with a database to allow them to convert from postcodes to Mailsort codes and receive a discount if they deliver mail to the post office split up by Mailsort code. Users providing outgoing mail sorted by postcode receive no such incentive since postcode areas and districts are assigned using permanent mnemonics and don't therefore assist with grouping items together into operationally significant blocks. Walksort was discontinued in May 2012.	numeric character	numeric character	16521-0	numeric character	numeric character	A digit from 0 to 9 in decimal notation

digit	In metrology, such as when performed in support of science, engineering or manufacturing objectives, dynamic range refers to the range of values that can be measured by a sensor or metrology instrument. Often this dynamic range of measurement is limited at one end of the range by saturation of a sensing signal sensor or by physical limits that exist on the motion or other response capability of a mechanical indicator. The other end of the dynamic range of measurement is often limited by one or more sources of random noise or uncertainty in signal levels that may be described as defining the sensitivity of the sensor or metrology device. When digital sensors or sensor signal converters are a component of the sensor or metrology device, the dynamic range of measurement will be also related to the number of binary @ @ digits @ @ ( bits ) used in a digital numeric representation in which the measured value is linearly related to the digital number. For example, a 12 - bit digital sensor or converter can provide a dynamic range in which the ratio of the maximum measured value to the minimum measured value is up to 2 = 4096.	numeric character	numeric character	16521-0	numeric character	numeric character	A digit from 0 to 9 in decimal notation

It was a typical early sauropodomorph, with a slender body, a long neck and a proportionally very small head. The vertebral column was composed of nine cervical ( neck ) vertebrae, 13 dorsal ( back ) vertebrae, three sacral ( hip ) vertebrae, and at least 40 caudal ( tail ) vertebrae. The pubis faced forward, as with most saurischians. It had a slighter build than that of " Plateosaurus ", an otherwise similar dinosaur. The neck was proportionally longer than in most other plateosaurids, with the foremost cervicals being four times the length of their width. The forelimbs were only half the length of the hindlimbs but quite powerful, as indicated by the broad upper end of the humerus that provided attachment areas for a large arm musculature. Like " Plateosaurus ", it had five @ @ digits @ @ on each hand and foot. The hand was short and wide, with a large sickle shaped thumb claw used for feeding or defense against predators. The thumb was the longest finger in the hand, while the fourth and fifth digits were tiny, giving the forepaws a lopsided look.	finger	finger	16521-2	finger	finger	One of the elements that collectively form a system of numeration

The cover hairs ( which comprise most of the fur ) are tricolored : for the basal two - thirds of their length, they are plumbeous gray ; the middle is ochraceous ; and the tip is dark brown to black. The longer guard hairs, which are most common towards the middle of the back, are completely black. The fur of the underparts appears dark gray and is not sharply demarcated from the upperparts. There, the hairs are also plumbeous at the bases, but the tips range from white to yellowish - brown. The mystacial vibrissae — whiskers above the mouth — are medium - sized.

digit	Rounding is used when the exact result of a floating - point operation ( or a conversion to floating - point format ) would need more @ @ digits @ @ than there are digits in the significand. IEEE 754 requires " correct rounding " : that is, the rounded result is as if infinitely precise arithmetic was used to compute the value and then rounded ( although in implementation only three extra bits are needed to ensure this ). There are several different rounding schemes ( or " rounding modes " ). Historically, truncation was the typical approach. Since the introduction of IEEE 754, the default method ( " round to nearest, ties to even ", sometimes called Banker's Rounding ) is more commonly used. This method rounds the ideal ( infinitely precise ) result of an arithmetic operation to the nearest representable value, and gives that representation as the result. In the case of a tie, the value that would make the significand end in an even digit is chosen. The IEEE 754 standard requires the same rounding to be applied to all fundamental algebraic operations, including square root and conversions, when there is a numeric ( non - NaN ) result. It means that the results of IEEE 754 operations are completely determined in all bits of the result, except for the representation of NaNs. ( " Library " functions such as cosine and log are not mandated. )	numeric character	numeric character	16521-0	numeric character	numeric character	A digit from 0 to 9 in decimal notation

Each terminal comes into contact with dendrites from 50 – 60 different granule cells. The granule cells themselves each have a single or multiple dendrites, and each participates in a different glomerulus. Glomeruli also contain the GABAergic ( inhibitory ) synapses of Golgi cells onto granule cells, and the glutamatergic ( excitatory ) synapses from mossy fibers onto Golgi cells. Each glomerulus contains approximately 50 granule cell dendrites, 210 total dendritic @ @ digits @ @ and 230 synaptic junctions.	finger	looks like a finger	16521-2	finger	finger	One of the elements that collectively form a system of numeration

digit	The Babylonian system of mathematics was a sexagesimal ( base 60 ) numeral system. From this we derive the modern - day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 degrees in a circle. The Babylonians were able to make great advances in mathematics for two reasons. Firstly, the number 60 is a superior highly composite number, having factors of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60 ( including those that are themselves composite ), facilitating calculations with fractions. Additionally, unlike the Egyptians and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place - value system, where @ @ digits @ @ written in the left column represented larger values ( much as, in our base ten system, 734 = 7×100 + 3×10 + 4×1 ).	numeric character	numeric character	16521-0	numeric character	numeric character	A digit from 0 to 9 in decimal notation
digit	The processing building block of the GTD - 5 EAX was the " processor complex ". These were each assigned a specific function within the overall switch design. In the original generation, Intel 8086 processors were used. These were replaced by NEC V30s ( an 80186 instruction set compatible processor with 8086 pinout implemented in CMOS and somewhat faster than the 8086 due to internal improvements ) in the second generation, and ultimately by 80386 processors. The APC was responsible for the craft interface to the system, administration of status control for all hardware devices, Recent Change, billing, and overall administration. The TPC was responsible for call sequence and state control. It received signalling inputs collected from peripheral processors ( see MXU, RLU, RSU, and TCU below ) and sent control information back to the peripheral processors. This term referred collectively to the APC and TPCs. Physically, this distinction made little sense, but was important from a software compilation standpoint. Since the APC and TPC processors shared a large memory - mapped space, some stages of compilation were performed in common. The TCU was responsible for a group of Facility Interface Units ( FIUs ). Each FIU was responsible for connecting the system to a particular class of physical connection : analog lines in the Analog Line FIU ( and its successor, the Extended Line FIU ) ; analog trunks in the Analog Trunk FIU ; and digital carrier in the Digital Trunk FIU and its successor, the EDT FIU. Unlike the SM in the competitive 5ESS Switch, the TCUs did not perform all call processing functions, but limited themselves to @ @ digit @ @ collection and signalling interpretation. The RSU was similar to the TCU, but had a network capable of local switching, and could process calls locally when links to the base unit were severed. The RLU was a condensed version of the RSU, with no local switching capability and limited line capacity. The MXU was actually a Lenkurt 914E Subscriber Loop Carrier. When integrated with the GTD - 5 EAX, it used a custom software load that permitted message communication with the remainder of the system.	numeric character	numeric character	16521-0	numeric character	numeric character	To point at or point out with the finger.

Because of the lack of resale data available for many of the emerging markets where pre - construction condo hotels can be found, experts heed caution when considering a condo hotel purchase for investment purposes alone. Just like traditional real estate, appreciation is never guaranteed. This very scenario most recently occurred in Las Vegas. Several of the more notable condo hotels have sold for less in the resale market than during pre - construction.	numeric character	numeric character	16521-1	numeric character	numeric character	One of the elements that collectively form a system of numeration
digit	When the information capacity of a storage system or a communication channel is presented in " bits " or " bits per second ", this often refers to binary @ @ digits @ @, which is a computer hardware capacity to store binary data ( 0 or 1, up or down, current or not, etc. ). Information capacity of a storage system is only an upper bound to the quantity of information stored therein. If the two possible values of one bit of storage are not equally likely, that bit of storage contains less than one bit of information. Indeed, if the value is completely predictable, then the reading of that value provides no information at all ( zero entropic bits, because no resolution of uncertainty occurs and therefore no information is available ). If a computer file that uses " n " bits of storage contains only " m " < " n " bits of information, then that information can in principle be encoded in about " m " bits, at least on the average. This principle is the basis of data compression technology. Using an analogy, the hardware binary digits refer to the amount of storage space available ( like the number of buckets available to store things ), and the information content the filling, which comes in different levels of granularity ( fine or coarse, that is, compressed or uncompressed information ). When the granularity is finer — when information is more compressed — the same bucket can hold more.	numeric character	numeric character	16521-0	numeric character	numeric character	A digit from 0 to 9 in decimal notation

hood	One of the period's most famous buildings, the Tribune Tower, emerged from a competition held by the Tribune Company in 1922 to celebrate its 75th anniversary. The newspaper was one of the largest in the world and used the competition, in which members of the public were invited to influence the design of the skyscraper, to build a loyal following amongst its readership and generate free publicity. The final design was determined by a competition panel largely made up of the company's appointees, who chose John Howells and Raymond @ @ Hood @ @'s tower design. The resulting tower was a conservative, Gothic design and controversy about the decision broke out almost immediately : Louis Sullivan and many others criticized Howells and Hood's design as being derivative of the Woolworth Tower. Regardless of its critics, the Tribune received as many as 20, 000 visitors to its observation gallery when it opened in 1925. The unbuilt second - place entry in the competition, a more simplified stepped - back design by Eliel Saarinen, also proved highly influential.	surname	surname	10776-1	surname	surname	An aggressive and violent young criminal

He joined ERA in Dunstable and, amongst other projected development and chassis work, designed and developed what became the Jupiter's tubular steel chassis. The suspension used soft torsion bars and anti - roll bars front and rear with independent suspension at the front. The engine was mounted very far forward ahead of the front axle line with the radiator low behind it over the gearbox. Adjustment of the anti - roll bars easily influenced oversteer and understeer to provide fine suspension tuning. On this torsionally stiff frame Reg Korner of Jowett put a steel framed aluminium drophead coupé body with a bench seat for three people.

hood	DeLillo interprets religion in " White Noise " unconventionally, most notably drawing comparisons between the Gladney's local supermarket and a religious institution on several occasions. Critic Karen Weekes argues that religion in " White Noise " has " lost its quality " and that it is a " devaluation " of traditional belief in a superhuman power. According to critic Tim Engles, DeLillo portrays protagonist Jack Gladney as " formulating his own prayers and seeking no solace from higher authority ". In addition, in the places the reader would expect to see religion, it is absent. Novelist and critic Joshua Ferris points out that " in a town like Blacksmith, the small mid - western university town of " White Noise ", the rites and rituals of traditional religion, such as church, bible study, and signs for Jesus, are expected ". However, God is largely absent in this suburb. He adds " the absence of religion is obvious, and places the novel in an entirely non - spiritual, post - Christian world. In " White Noise ", not even Catholic nuns believe in God. " However, Professor Majeed Jadwe countered with, " " White Noise " begins and ends with a ritual. The first is the convoy of station wagons arriving for the new school year, which Jack describes as an event which he has not missed in 21 years. It ends with the public ritual of self - @ @ hood @ @ perfection. " Professor Jadwe implies that although religion is not presented in the book, the concept of ritual is still present. The society portrayed in White Noise utilizes ritual in other areas such as Jack never missing the convoy. The world of " White Noise " is still obsessed with ritual despite the absence of religion. Associate Director of Language and Writing, Christopher S. Glover, agreed by stating, " Just after the nun tells Jack that there exists nothing worth believing in and that anyone who does believe in something is a fool, DeLillo dangles this event in front of us, daring us to believe in something — anything — by using religious buzzwords such as'mystical ','exalted ', and'profound'but countering those words with others like'lame - brained '.

hood	The identities of other three figures in this work are relatively clear. The body of Christ just after his crucifixion in the middle, being assisted by a distraught Virgin Mary to his left and a cold and distant Mary Magdalene to his right. All three of the known figures are in some way helped by the hooded figure in supporting Christ's body. The hooded figure can be one of two people, or even both. Historians argue that the figure can either be Joseph of Arimathea or Nicodemus, the latter of which is most generally accepted. Conventionally speaking, Joseph of Arimathea is usually shown with a beard and broods over Christ's head, just like the figure in this here. On the other hand, this figure could be Nicodemus who is typically shown with some type of head covering, which would be the @ @ hood @ @ in this case. Both Joseph and Nicodemus had significant roles in Christ's final days and the subsequent actions after his death. Joseph gave up his own tomb for Christ to use and he helped remove Christ's body from the cross. Nicodemus moreover, had a conversation with Christ about how one could be born again and obtain eternal life. From that conversation on, Nicodemus became involved with Christ and also aided Joseph of Arimathea in Christ's deposition. Since both Joseph and Nicodemus were involved in the deposition, there is a strong argument that that is the scene being shown, so much so that to some, this work is known as The Deposition. Christ's serpentine shaped body sulks heavily in the arms of his loved ones as if he was in the process of descending from the cross straight into his mother's arms. The pained expression on the Virgin's face would resemble the look on her face upon first seeing her dead child with surrounding figures being there to support her.	headgear	headgear	11542-1	headgear	headgear	An aggressive and violent young criminal

java	The largest populations of wild banteng occur in Cambodia, @ @ Java @ @ and possibly in Borneo ( particularly Sabah ) and Thailand. Domesticated banteng occur in Bali and many eastern Indonesian islands ( such as Sulawesi, Sumbawa, and Sumba ), Australia, Malaysia and New Guinea. Feral populations are found in East Kalimantan and the Northern Territory ( Australia ). Domesticated populations are primarily used for their highly demanded meat, and are used as draught animals to a lesser extent. The wild banteng is classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, and populations have decreased by more than 50 % in the past few decades. Rampant poaching ( for food, game, traditional medicine and horns ), habitat loss and fragmentation and susceptibility to disease are major threats throughout the range. Banteng are legally protected in all countries in their range, and are largely restricted to protected areas ( possibly barring Cambodia ). The banteng is the second endangered species to be successfully cloned, and the first clone to survive beyond infancy.	island in indonesia	Island in Indonesia	9155-0	Island in Indonesia	Island in Indonesia	Couldn't match sense
java	The island's exceptional fertility and rainfall allowed the development of wet - field rice cultivation, which required sophisticated levels of cooperation between villages. Out of these village alliances, small kingdoms developed. The chain of volcanic mountains and associated highlands running the length of @ @ Java @ @ kept its interior regions and peoples separate and relatively isolated. Before the advent of Islamic states and European colonialism, the rivers provided the main means of communication, although Java's many rivers are mostly short. Only the Brantas and Sala rivers could provide long - distance communication, and this way their valleys supported the centres of major kingdoms. A system of roads, permanent bridges and toll gates is thought to have been established in Java by at least the mid - 17th century. Local powers could disrupt the routes as could the wet season and road use was highly dependent on constant maintenance. Consequently, communication between Java's population was difficult.	island in indonesia	Island in Indonesia	9155-0	Island in Indonesia	Island in Indonesia	Couldn't match sense

Oracle originally sought damages up to $ 6. 1 billion, but this valuation was rejected by a United States federal judge who asked Oracle to revise the estimate. In response, Google submitted multiple lines of defense, counterclaiming that Android did not infringe on Oracle's patents or copyright, that Oracle's patents were invalid, and several other defenses. They said that Android's Java runtime environment is based on Apache Harmony, a clean room implementation of the Java class libraries, and an independently developed virtual machine called Dalvik. In May 2012, the jury in this case found that Google did not infringe on Oracle's patents, and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the Java APIs used by Google was not copyrightable. The parties agreed to zero dollars in statutory damages for a small amount of copied code. On May 9, 2014, the Federal Circuit partially reversed the district court ruling, ruling in Oracle's favor on the copyrightability issue, and remanding the issue of fair use to the district court.	programming language	programming language	9155-1	programming language	programming language	Couldn't match sense

java	The Portuguese first landed in Ambon in 1513, but it only became the new centre for their activities in Maluku following the expulsion from Ternate. European power in the region was weak and Ternate became an expanding, fiercely Islamic and anti - European state under the rule of Sultan Baab Ullah ( r. 1570 – 1583 ) and his son Sultan Said. The Portuguese in Ambon, however, were regularly attacked by native Muslims on the island's northern coast, in particular Hitu which had trading and religious links with major port cities on @ @ Java @ @'s north coast. Altogether, the Portuguese never had the resources or manpower to control the local trade in spices, and failed in attempts to establish their authority over the crucial Banda Islands, the nearby centre of most nutmeg and mace production. Following Portuguese missionary work, there have been large Christian communities in eastern Indonesia particularly among the Ambonese. By the 1560s there were 10, 000 Catholics in the area, mostly on Ambon, and by the 1590s there were 50, 000 to 60, 000, although most of the region surrounding Ambon remained Muslim.	island in indonesia	Island in Indonesia	9155-0	Island in Indonesia	Island in Indonesia	Couldn't match sense

However, in 1297, a new local power emerged. Myinsaing Kingdom became the real ruler of Central Burma and challenged the Mongol rule. This resulted in the second Mongol invasion of Burma in 1300, which was repulsed by Myinsaing. The Mongols would later in 1303 withdrawn from Burma. In 1292, The Mongols sent envoys to Singhasari Kingdom in Java to ask for submission to Mongol rule.

java	There has been some confusion about how to categorize the many Indian music systems. The widely used great - little traditions dichotomy ( great for " classical " and little for local or " folk " systems ) or – their Indian variation – margi - desi sangit - seems unsuitable to be forced upon Kerala's musics. Many criteria for the'great traditions ', like professional status and training of the musicians, could be applied to the majority of the kavu and kshetram musical genres. Kerala musics – like Indian musics in general – consist of complex and interrelated traditions, established on a secular – sacred, and canonised – less canonised continuum, performed by professional, semi - professional and / or amateur musicians. In Kerala there has always been a strong emotional debate about whether the musical styles of Kerala constitute an independent category within Indian music or merely count as a subdivision of the Karnatik music system. While the Karnatik vocalist Venkitasubramonia Iyer, for instance, states that " the music of Kerala is fundamentally identical with the music of the rest of South India " ( 1969 : 5 ), the dramatist Kavalam Panikkar asserts "... each region of the south had its own musical culture which continues to retain its identity... " ( 1991 : 132 ). From an'all - Indian perspective'we would suggest that there is no close relationship between Karnatik music and Kshetram vadyam and therefore both should be regarded as distinct music systems. The main differences are the ritualistic concepts, the relationship of music and musicians towards the ritual, the musician communities, genres, musical instruments, the tala ( rhythmic ) system, and the organisation and importance of rhythm within the overall concept. The similarities between both systems are not more significant than between Kshetram vadyam and any other music system in India. In the face of the ancient trade relations between Kerala and South - East Asia it might even be interesting to compare Kerala music with some of the genres prevalent on the Indonesian islands of Bali or @ @ Java @ @. Finally, it needs to be said that the performers, being part of a living and still amazingly popular tradition, are not particularly concerned about these questions.	island in indonesia	Island in Indonesia	9155-0	Island in Indonesia	Island in Indonesia	Couldn't match sense

During the transition to the New Order, deposed first president of Indonesia Sukarno was placed under house arrest, and he requested that he be buried in a simple grave close to the Bogor Palace. Following Sukarno's death on 21 June 1970, then - incumbent Suharto decided to bury the former president in a public cemetery at Blitar, East Java, next to Sukarno's mother's grave. Sukarno's family protested his burial in Blitar, and the anti - Suharto newspaper " Merdeka " published an editorial stating that Sukarno had wished to be buried near Bandung. In his later autobiography, Suharto claimed that Sukarno's large family had differing views on the burial site, and argued that Sukarno had been very close to his mother during her life. A historian later claimed that Suharto's decision to bury Sukarno in Blitar was to avoid pilgrimages to Sukarno's grave too close to the political center of power in Jakarta.	island in indonesia	Island in Indonesia	9155-0	Island in Indonesia	Island in Indonesia	An island in Indonesia to the south of Borneo; one of the world's most densely populated regions

java	Raffles took his residence at Buitenzorg and despite having a small subset of Britons as his senior staff, he kept many of the Dutch civil servants in the governmental structure.

Most significant of these was 21 June 1812 assault on Yogyakarta, one of the two most powerful indigenous polities in @ @ Java @ @. During the attack the Yogyakarta kraton was badly damaged and extensively looted by British troops. Raffles seized much of the contents of the court archive. The event was unprecedented in Javanese history. It was the first time an indigenous court had been taken by storm by a European army, and the humiliation of the local aristocracy was profound. Although peace returned to Central Java in the immediate aftermath of the British assault, the events may have fuelled the deep - seated instability and hostility to European involvement that ultimately gave rise to the Java War of the 1820s. Raffles also ordered an expedition to Palembang in Sumatra to unseat the local sultan, Mahmud Badaruddin II, and to seize the nearby Bangka Island to set up a permanent British presence in the area.

java	Logic models are used to model the life cycles of cells, immune synapse, pathogen recognition and viral entries on a microscopic and mesoscopic level. Unlike the ODE models, details about the kinetics and concentrations of interacting species isn't required in logistic models. Each biochemical species is represented as a node in the network and can have a finite number of discrete states, usually two, for example : ON / OFF, high / low, active / inactive. Usually, logic models, with only two states are considered as Boolean models. When a molecule is in the OFF state, it means that the molecule isn't present at a high enough level to make a change in the system, not that it has zero concentration. Therefore, when it is in the ON state it has reached a high enough amount to initiate a reaction. This method was first introduced by Kauffman. The limit of this model is that it can only provide qualitative approximations of the system and it can ’ t perfectly model concurrent events. < br > < br > This method has been used to explore special pathways in the immune system such as affinity maturation and hypermutation in the humoral immune system and tolerance to pathologic rheumatoid factors. Simulation tools that support this model are DDlab, Cell - Devs and IMMSIM - C. IMMSIM - C is used more often than the others, as it doesn ’ t require knowledge in the computer programming field.

Fernandez del Portillo noted in 1610 that while Gibraltar was " girt by quite a good wall with bastions at corners ", there still remained work to be done to complete the fortification plans that had been drawn up in the previous century. He felt that " perhaps what does exist is enough to withstand an assault and more.

The host membranes were chosen because their phase diagrams are well understood and have been extensively characterized by different analytical techniques. 6 The nearest neighbor recognition technique is being applied to the formation of the modeled membranes to observe the association between cholesterol and phospholipids as well as the effects that the presence of ethanol has against this interaction. Researchers are observing whether or not ethanol enhances or disrupts the liquid - ordered phase by reorganizing this formation into a liquid - disordered phase. The liquid - ordered phase is similar to a lamellar phase and the liquid - disordered phase represents the non - lamellar phases but the exact type of each phase ( hexagonal, cubic, etc. ) is not described. As previously mentioned several different combinations of the host membranes, exchanging molecules, and cholesterol are created to form the model membranes. It is important to mention that the exchanging molecules selected have similar properties to the host membranes. The exchanging lipids contain disulfide bonds as well as diacylglycerol groups that are not necessarily present in the host membranes. Studies provide evidence through monolayer measurements, condensing properties, and nearly identical gel to liquid - crystalline phase transition temperatures ( Tm ) to the host membranes that the presence of these bonds don't play a major role or interfere in the recognition or packing formation of the modeled membranes in the presence of ethanol. The disulfide bonds, diacylglycerol bonds, and similar sterol framework are only present to mimic the physical properties of DSPC, DPPC, and cholesterol as well as aid in the monomer exchanging processes to form exchangeable dimers.

Flashbacks are found throughout the film to reference the origin of relationships and the side the characters stand on. Flashbacks create some delicate details at the same time and these details can create implicit meaning directors wants to indicate. For example, the flashback before Hon Sam died indicate the master ‘ s prophecy to him that “ What millions died that Caesar might be great ”. And flashback when Chan wing - yan see the portfolio which he write a word on it for his friends on place of Liu, indicate Liu is the @ @ mole @ @. Scene changes are often made through the use of jump cuts, freeze - frame shots, and fade outs. Whereas dialogues within the film are often captured by close - ups. The importance of jump cuts provides the effect of jumping forwards in time, and manipulating the duration of a single - shot, therefore moving the audience forward into time and establishing the next scene. In addition, the use of freeze - frame shots provides the illusion that the action has ceased, establishing an important moment of the film. This provides characters the time for internal dialogue and leave an iconic lasting image. Fade outs provides the audience the understanding and indicates that a period of time has passed during the film. The use of close - ups establishes the character's face through the use of zooming in to heightens the actor's ability and empowers emotions in a film scene. Besides, can make viewers agree with the narration of film.

The best - known food product is " cajeta ", a soft, spreadable sweet product made with goat's milk, sugar, and flavorings. The best known place for this is Celaya. The cajeta can be flavored with vanilla, coconut, strawberry, and others ; it is eaten with a spoon from the container, spread on bread, or made into candies. Another typical sweet in the state is called charamuscas. It is made with piloncillo, which is melted to form shapes. In the city of Guanajuato, one can find charamuscas in the shape of mummies. Alfeñique refers to glass sugar based candies used to form figures and is most popular for Day of the Dead. Chilacayote is a candy made from a type of melon of the same name, which is prepared by soaking pieces of the fruit in sugar solution. Handmade ice cream is a specialty of Dolores Hidalgo, made with all natural ingredients, often using recipes passed down for generations. While ice cream and ices are made in other parts of the state, these stand out because of the many unusual flavors offered such as beer, pulque, chile relleno, even shrimp and @ @ mole @ @.

In North America, this diet largely consists of the isopods " Excirolana linguifrons ", " Excirolana kincaidii ", and the @ @ mole @ @ crab, " Emerita analoga ". When the tide is out, these crustaceans live in burrows some way beneath the surface. When the tide comes in, they move into the upper layers of sand and feed on the plankton and detritus that washes over them with each wave. They then burrow rapidly down again as the water retreats. They leave no marks on the surface, so the sanderlings hunt for them by plunging their beaks into the sand at random, consuming whatever they find. Their bills can penetrate only and as the water swirls around and retreats, the sand is softer ; this makes it easier for the birds'beaks to penetrate further. In the spring, when much breeding activity is taking place in the benthic community, there may be as many as 4000 invertebrates per square metre, but their average size is smaller than later in the year. The birds appear to rush madly around at the edge of the surf, but in reality they are maximising their chances of catching as many prey animals as possible when they are at their most vulnerable near the surface.	rodent	rodent	26365-0	rodent	rodent	The molecular weight of a substance expressed in grams; the basic unit of amount of substance adopted under the Systeme International d'Unites

mole	The third programme features Africa's deserts, whose swathes of sand and rock cover half the continent. It begins in the Namib by demonstrating some of the unusual strategies that desert insects and spiders have evolved to survive. With no more than 5 cm of rain each year, this is Africa's driest desert. On warm nights, sea fog forms over the cold ocean and blows across the dunes, bringing vital, life - sustaining moisture. Even large animals can survive here ; elephants use knowledge passed down through generations to find sustenance. Nara melons make a nutritious meal, and Cape porcupines and hairy - footed gerbils take advantage too. Neighbouring the Namib is the Karoo, which benefits from winter rains. The blossoming of flowering plants in the spring is shown using time - lapse. The rains also trigger the emergence of locusts, which swarm together and destroy all fresh growth in their path. In the Kalahari, there is enough rain for grasses and stunted trees to grow. The co - operative strategies of Damaraland @ @ mole @ @ - rats, meerkats and sociable weavers are compared. The grasses support grazing animals such as springbok, which in turn attract predators. The cheetah, with its thin, lightly furred body is most at home in the desert.

Ancient rock art in Chad ’ s Ennedi Plateau shows a vanished world – giraffe, elephant, rhino and other savannah creatures.

mole	Guillam is a major character in " Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy ", which retcons the chronology of " Call for the Dead " to make Guillam only forty in 1973. At the outset of the book, the failure of a major operation called " Testify " has resulted in Smiley and the former head of the Circus, Control, being fired. Guillam survives the purge of personnel loyal to Smiley, but is demoted to the head of the " Scalphunters, " fieldmen used in operations that require physical action and / or violence. The position is seen as one of the least desirable in the Circus, described humorously by Smiley as " cosh and carry ". One of Guillam's agents, Ricki Tarr, inadvertently learns that the failure of Operation Testify — and Smiley's subsequent termination from the Circus — was due to the presence of a @ @ mole @ @ in the highest echelons of British intelligence. When contacted by Tarr and unsure of whom to trust, he goes to senior Civil Servant Oliver Lacon and, acting as his link man, Guillam facilitates Smiley's secret return from retirement in order to conduct a surreptitious investigation into the identity of the mole. Guillam is motivated not only by his loyalty to Smiley but also because, as a result of Gerald's actions, a network of secret agents he ran in Former French North Africa were identified and executed. Guillam acts as Smiley's man on the inside in the investigation, which involves his actually stealing files from The Circus Registry at Smiley's request. Over the course of the novel, Guillam grows progressively paranoid and anxious regarding the investigation, at one point doubting the veracity of Tarr's allegations. When the mole is finally identified, Guillam loses his temper and physically attacks him, having to be restrained by the other men in the room.	spy	spy	26365-1	spy	spy	The molecular weight of a substance expressed in grams; the basic unit of amount of substance adopted under the Systeme International d'Unites

There have been suggestions that its taxonomic position should change in the light of new scientific information. Modern authors tend to separate this and some closely related mole rat species from other " Spalax " species by classifying them into a separate genus named " Nannospalax ". A cariological study showed that " Nannospalax leucodon " is a superspecies consisting of several cariologically distinct cryptic species. According to this definition there are four separate cariological forms in the Carpathian Basin, one of them endangered and another one vulnerable while insufficient data are available to evaluate the conservation status of the other two forms.	rodent	rodent	26365-0	rodent	rodent	Small velvety-furred burrowing mammal having small eyes and fossorial forefeet

mole	Thermodynamic data is usually presented as a table or chart of function values for one @ @ mole @ @ of a substance ( or in the case of the steam tables, one kg ). A thermodynamic datafile is a set of equation parameters from which the numerical data values can be calculated. Tables and datafiles are usually presented at a standard pressure of 1 bar or 1 atm, but in the case of steam and other industrially important gases, pressure may be included as a variable. Function values depend on the state of aggregation of the substance, which must be defined for the value to have any meaning. The state of aggregation for thermodynamic purposes is the " standard state ", sometimes called the " reference state ", and defined by specifying certain conditions. The " normal " standard state is commonly defined as the most stable physical form of the substance at the specified temperature and a pressure of 1 bar or 1 atm. However, since any non - normal condition could be chosen as a standard state, it must be defined in the context of use. A " physical " standard state is one that exists for a time sufficient to allow measurements of its properties. The most common physical standard state is one that is stable thermodynamically ( i. e., the normal one ). It has no tendency to transform into any other physical state. If a substance can exist but is not thermodynamically stable ( for example, a supercooled liquid ), it is called a " metastable " state. A " non " - " physical " standard state is one whose properties are obtained by extrapolation from a physical state ( for example, a solid superheated above the normal melting point, or an ideal gas at a condition where the real gas is non - ideal ). Metastable liquids and solids are important because some substances can persist and be used in that state indefinitely. Thermodynamic functions that refer to conditions in the normal standard state are designated with a small superscript °. The relationship between certain physical and thermodynamic properties may be described by an equation of state.	unit	unit	26365-2	unit	unit	The molecular weight of a substance expressed in grams; the basic unit of amount of substance adopted under the Systeme International d'Unites

Although the CIA's Soviet - East European ( SE ) and Central Eurasian divisions knew or suspected the sources to be Soviet double agents, they nevertheless disseminated this " feed " material within the government.

Conversely, many bees are haplodiploid yet are not eusocial, and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males, resulting in a hive of half - sisters that share only 25 % of their genes. The association between haplodiploidy and eusociality is below statistical significance. Haplodiploidy alone is thus neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality to emerge. However relatedness does still play a part, as monogamy ( queens mating singly ) has been shown to be the ancestral state for all eusocial species so far investigated. If kin selection is an important force driving the evolution of eusociality, monogamy should be the ancestral state, because it maximizes the relatedness of colony members.	rodent	rodent	26365-0	rodent	rodent	Small velvety-furred burrowing mammal having small eyes and fossorial forefeet
mole	In the 1890s, the Opportunist republican parable ended as the Panama scandals of 1892 involved prominent Radical politicians like Clemenceau, Alfred Naquet and Léon Bourgeois, granting a large victory to the ANR in the legislative elections the following year. However, the Dreyfus affair broke out in 1893, causing the formation of two factions, namely the Dreyfusards like Émile Zola, Anatole France and Clemenceau who supported the innocence of the Jewish Colonel and the Anti - Dreyfusard like Édouard Drumont, Jules Méline and Raymond Poincaré who accused Dreyfus of betrayal, partially due to rampant antisemitism. The ANR, which Méline and Poincaré were members of, refused the antisemitic thesis, but took side with the Anti - Dreyfus field. This decision was fatal for the ANR's destiny. In 1899, the re - conviction of the Colonel Dreyfus, with a partial pardon favored by the republican Pierre Waldeck - Rousseau, caused divisions inside the ANR, aggravated by the rehabilitation of Dreyfus in 1900. To remove the @ @ mole @ @ of antisemitism, Waldeck - Rousseau founded the Democratic Republican Alliance ( ADR ) in 1901, claiming the heritage of Ferry and Gambetta. Many Moderate Republicans joined the ADR, including Yves Guyot, Ferdinand Dreyfus ( not linked with the Colonel ), Narcisse Leven and David Raynal. The Moderate Republicans who had remained in the ANR finally adhered along with Progressive Republicans to the Republican Federation, a right - wing party very distant from the original ANR's beliefs.	clump of growing tissue	other (metaphorical mole)	26365-3	clump of growing tissue	clump of growing tissue	The molecular weight of a substance expressed in grams; the basic unit of amount of substance adopted under the Systeme International d'Unites

Willard came back strong, however, in the later rounds of the bout, drove McCarty back with his accurate left jabs, shook McCarty from head to toes with terrific right uppercuts, and had him bleeding from the mouth, nose and forehead. Both of McCarty's eyes were swollen when he left the right, and Willard carried a large bruise on his left cheek. " The fight was granted a draw from " The New York Sun ", " Chicago Tribune ", " The Boston Daily Globe ", whilst being granted a newspaper decision for Willard from " The New York Times ". Willard was given the verdict almost unanimously by the New York papers, and it was said in reports of the contest that McCarty was hardly able to land one telling blow on him.

Indian advance then moved on to capture Dograi, a town in the immediate vicinity of Lahore. After reaching the outskirts of Lahore Indian Army ensured that Lahore came under constant Indian tank fire to prepare for the main assault on Lahore city before ceasefire was announced. In the north India won another decisive battle at Phillora supported by its 1 Armoured Division on 11th destroying the Pakistani counterattack. Indians continued to advance towards Chawinda in the north from Phillora and reached Chawinda by 17 September. However, they were halted at Chawinda till ceasefire on 22 September. This was a result of the exceptional defences backed by artillery were created by Pakistani Brigadier A. A. K. Niazi who had started preparing the defences soon after fall of Phillora. Indian attack in the north only lost momentum at the Battle of Chawinda, after more than 500 km of Pakistani territory had been captured. The Pakistanis were helped by the fact that the network of canals and streams in the sector made for natural defensive barriers. In addition, the prepared defence, comprising minefields, dugouts and more elaborate pillboxes, proved problematic for the Indians.	repeated hitting	repeated hitting	10074-2	repeated hitting	repeated hitting	Hit hard with the hand, fist, or some heavy instrument

pound	The co - operative movement's market share and profitability continued to decline during the 1970s and 80s in part due to a number of reasons. Firstly the process of de - industrialisation which characterised the period led to serious economic difficulties in many of the movements heartlands ( notably the northern industrial towns ) which disproportionally impacted on the societies through a decrease in consumer spending despite the British economy seeing a rise in consumer disposable income overall. This was largely due to the strong increase in inequality in the UK at this time and the co - operative movement was not well placed to tap into this increase in middle class spending due to the geographic spread of its stores and the co - op's historic association as the shop for the'working poor '. Secondly redevelopment projects in many cities between the 1950s and 1970s often moved people from rows of terraced housing ( which featured co - op stores dotted throughout ) to newer purpose - built estates, with around 18, 000 co - op stores closing as they become redundant in this way.

The co - operative movement did build some superstores, having 74 by 1986, but often their development and competitiveness was hindered by the lack of a national distribution network and price competitiveness.	currency	currency	10074-1	currency	currency	16 ounces avoirdupois

What had once been a busy intersection had become totally desolate. With the clearance of most of the remaining bomb - damaged buildings on both sides ( on the eastern side, this was done chiefly to give border guards a clear view of would - be escapees and an uninterrupted line of fire ), little was left in an area of dozens of hectares. Further demolitions occurred up until 1976 when the Haus Vaterland finally disappeared. After that, only two buildings in the immediate vicinity of Potsdamer Platz still stood – one complete, the other in a half - ruined fragmented form : the Weinhaus Huth's steel skeleton had enabled the building to withstand the pounding of World War II virtually undamaged, and it stood out starkly amid a great levelled wasteland, although now occupied only by groups of squatters.

The procedure is less technically demanding than the graciloplasty, but there is the disadvantage of using foreign material, which can erode through the anal canal. As with graciloplasty, obstructed defecation may develop with a working device, and may be treated with enemas. Complications include infection, which may warrant temporary removal of the device.

C. as ambassador to the United States ; Lord Beaverbrook as Minister of Aircraft Production ; Sir Kingsley Wood as Chancellor of the Exchequer ; and Sir John Anderson as Lord President of the Council – replacing Chamberlain who died in November ( Anderson later became Chancellor after Kingsley Wood's death in September 1943 ). Jenkins described this combination as a " war cabinet for winning ", contrasting it with Chamberlain's " war cabinet for losing ". In response to previous criticisms that there had been no clear single minister in charge of the prosecution of the war, Churchill created and took the additional position of Minister of Defence, making him the most powerful wartime prime minister in British history.	stamp	emblem	19200-4	emblem	emblem	Fastener consisting of a resinous composition that is plastic when warm; used for sealing documents and parcels and letters

seal	The second procedure is the dismantling of the site. First, the radioactive fuel is removed, some of which can be recycled and refined for further use in a reactor. The most dangerous waste is placed inside radioactive - resistant containers, after which the containers are transported to storage facilities. The rest of the site can then be decontaminated through various means. The site is then checked thoroughly for any signs of radiation. Most of the remaining waste onsite can be disposed of normally as it is either not contaminated or radioactivity levels have dropped to within safe limits. This process is often completed using robots, which are able to access the difficult to reach areas deemed too radioactive for human workers. Section : : : : 2 : : : : Entombment. The procedure of entombment is a time extensive process. The simplest of the procedures is entombing the radioactive waste source at the site itself. After containment and disposal of lower - level radioactive spent fuel sources, the entombment process of high - level radioactive parts of the plant may begin. The first step is to cover the area with a protective shield which is usually made up of radioactive - resistant materials, this allows workers to continue working with a significantly lower radioactive environment. The next step is the most crucial and time consuming, it involves encasing the site in cement, absorbent grout, or infills. Each layer of cement, grout or infills must set and cure before the next layer is added and thus, time and proper testing is required to ensure the safe containment of radiation. Once the encasement is complete the final step is often to surround the site in a clay or sand / gravel mixture and then the soil is laid on top of the site. The use of many layers allows for the maximum shielding of radioactivity. The site must be routinely checked for breaches in the containment barrier for decades. Therefore, entombment is often considered as a last resort solution to the decommissioning of a nuclear power plant or nuclear disaster site. An example would be a waste disposal facility in El Cabril, Spain that uses a multi - concrete barrier concept. The concept includes placing the radioactive waste drums inside concrete boxes and placing those boxes inside a reinforced concrete vault.

seal	Perhaps the most common example of purely mechanical thermostat technology in use today is the internal combustion engine cooling system thermostat, used to maintain the engine near its optimum operating temperature by regulating the flow of coolant to an air - cooled radiator. This type of thermostat operates using a @ @ sealed @ @ chamber containing a wax pellet that melts and expands at a set temperature. The expansion of the chamber operates a rod which opens a valve when the operating temperature is exceeded. The operating temperature is determined by the composition of the wax. Once the operating temperature is reached, the thermostat progressively increases or decreases its opening in response to temperature changes, dynamically balancing the coolant recirculation flow and coolant flow to the radiator to maintain the engine temperature in the optimum range. On many automobile engines, including all Chrysler Group and General Motors products, the thermostat does not restrict flow to the heater core. The passenger side tank of the radiator is used as a bypass to the thermostat, flowing through the heater core. This prevents formation of steam pockets before the thermostat opens, and allows the heater to function before the thermostat opens. Another benefit is that there is still some flow through the radiator if the thermostat fails.	close completely	close completely	9438-0	close completely	close completely	Make tight; secure against leakage

Another major economic activity for limis had been the production of wooden bowl. These wooden bowls prepared in limi are circulated throughout Tibet from the border town of Burang. Limi's high altitude and harsh climate poses many difficulties for agriculture. Farming is only possible in the months from April to October. Small scale Terrace farming is widely practiced with only enough output for self - consumption. traditional farming practices are followed and the use of machines and chemical fertilizers are non - existential. Yak and zo manure is used. Barley, green peas, radish and cabbage are grown. Animal husbandry is a part of life in Limi. all of the grasslands are far from the villages as most of the land in and around the village is used for farming. The Limi people rely heavily on animals for everyday needs. Yak, zo, horses, sheep and goats are raised. These animals are herded to various grasslands depending on the season. Yak is the most useful of these animals its milk and meat is used for nourishment ; its fur is used to make threads, tents, ropes, sacks, clothes, quilts and rugs ; its hide is used to make bags, drums and shoes ; it also is an excellent beast of burden. Yak is also in demand for its meat in and is regularly sold for high prices. Historically the men of Limi have always been traders, this can be partly attributed to the fact that basic commodities like salt and flour could not be locally obtained. Cross border trade with Tibet has been prevalent for centuries. Barter trade was the norm of the day and wool was sent from Limi in exchange for salt. This salt was then traded in Humla. Today much of the face of the trade has changed. An average Limi trader fares much better than his predecessors, in that the scope and magnitude of the business has increased. Wooden handicrafts like bowls and traditional tables are sent to Tibet in exchange for essential food items.	emerge	emerge	3450-2	emerge/coil	emerge/coil	Move forward by leaps and bounds

That year he financed the laying of a new pavement outside Rochester Guildhall, the commemorative stone for which still remains in place on the front of the building. He was given command of a squadron sent to La Rochelle in May 1706 and took part in the capture of Ostend in June 1706. In each of these actions he was personally involved in dangerous inshore operations and was said to have " courted danger like a mistress ".	season	season	5350-1	season	season	Move forward by leaps and bounds

In 2015, Sakaguchi stated that, from the beginning, the team had wished for a name that could be shortened to ; that way, the game's title could be abbreviated in the Latin script and pronounced in four syllables in the Japanese language. The original working title for Sakaguchi's RPG concept was " Fighting Fantasy ", but it was changed to avoid issues with a tabletop game of the same name that had already been released. The reason for choosing the word " final " to form the eventual title of " Final Fantasy " was explained as twofold by Uematsu : for one thing, it stemmed from Sakaguchi's personal situation, as he would have quit the game industry and gone back to university had the game not sold well, and for another, @ @ Square @ @ was under the threat of bankruptcy at the time, which meant the game could have been the company's last.

square	The series affected @ @ Square @ @'s business on several levels. The commercial failure of " Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within " resulted in hesitation and delays from Enix during merger discussions with Square. Square's decision to produce games exclusively for the Sony PlayStation — a move followed by Enix's decision with the " Dragon Quest " series — severed their relationship with Nintendo. " Final Fantasy " games were absent from Nintendo consoles, specifically the Nintendo 64, for seven years. Critics attribute the switch of strong third - party games like the " Final Fantasy " and " Dragon Quest " games to Sony's PlayStation, and away from the Nintendo 64, as one of the reasons behind PlayStation being the more successful of the two consoles. The release of the Nintendo GameCube, which used optical disc media, in 2001 caught the attention of Square. To produce games for the system, Square created the shell company The Game Designers Studio and released " Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles ", which spawned its own metaseries within the main franchise. " Final Fantasy XI " s lack of an online method of subscription cancellation prompted the creation of legislation in Illinois that requires internet gaming services to provide such a method to the state's residents.	part of name	company	4656-1	part of name	company	Square Co., Ltd. was a Japanese video game company foundedin September 1986 by Masafumi Miyamoto.

square	Though Karagöz theatre requires a skilled puppeteer who is capable of controlling the puppets and using different voices, it only requires about four people for a performance that can include dozens of characters. An apprentice, called the " sandıkkâr ", assists the puppeteer — who is called either the " Karagözcü ", hayalî ( meaning both " imaginary " and " image creator " ) or " hayalbaz " — by handing him the puppets in the correct order and setting up the theatre before the show. A singer, or " yardak ", might sing a song in the prelude, but the " yardak " is never responsible for voicing a character. The " yardak " may be accompanied by a " dairezen " on a tambourine. The simple design of karagöz theatre makes it easy to transport ; the puppets are all flat and the screen can be folded into a neat @ @ square @ @, which is optimal for traveling karagöz artists. The screen and table behind it take up much less space than a stage so that a performance can be set up anywhere that is dark enough for shadows to be cast. A single " hayalî " impersonates every single character in the play by mimicking sounds, talking in different dialects, chanting or singing songs of the character in focus. He is normally assisted by an apprentice who sets up and tears down, and who hands him the puppets as needed. The latter task might also be performed by a " sandıkkâr " ( from " " " sandık " ", " chest " ). A " yardak " might sing songs, and a " dairezen " play the tambourine.	shape	shape	1961-1	shape	shape	(geometry) a plane rectangle with four equal sides and four right angles; a four-sided regular polygon

square	The two main groups of squat lobsters share most features of their morphology. They resemble true lobsters in some ways, but are somewhat flattened dorsoventrally, and are typically smaller. Squat lobsters vary in carapace length ( measured from the eye socket to the rear edge ), from in the case of " Munidopsis aries ", down to only a few millimetres in the case of " Galathea intermedia " and some species of " Uroptychus ". As in other decapod crustaceans, the body of a squat lobster may be divided into two main regions : the cephalothorax ( itself made up of the " cephalon ", or head, and the thorax ), and the pleon or abdomen. The cephalothorax is made of 13 body segments ( somites ), although the divisions are not obvious and are most easily inferred from the paired appendages. From front to back, these are, the two pairs of antennae, six pairs of mouthparts ( mandibles, maxillae, maxillules and three pairs of maxillipeds ), five pairs of pereiopods. The cephalothorax is covered with a thick carapace, which may extend forwards in front of the eyes to form a rostrum ; this is highly variable among squat lobsters, being vestigial in " Chirostylus ", wide and often serrated in some genera, and long, narrow, and flanked with " supraorbital spines " in others. The degree of ornamentation on the surface of the carapace also varies widely, and there are almost always at least a few setae ( bristles ), which can be iridescent in some members of the Galatheidae and Munididae. A pair of compound eyes also project on stalks from the front of the carapace ; these are made up of ommatidia with @ @ square @ @ facets, which is typical of the " reflecting superposition " form of eye. Many deep - sea species have reduced eyes, and reduced movement of the eyestalks.

This follows from the fact that an aromatic fullerene must have full icosahedral ( or other appropriate ) symmetry, so the molecular orbitals must be entirely filled. This is possible only if there are exactly 2 ( " n " + 1 ) electrons, where " n " is a nonnegative integer.

The colour itself is significant ; red is a festive colour for the Chinese people, used to convey a sense of celebration and nationalism. Moreover, the red colour is identical to that used in the national PRC flag, chosen to signify the link re - established between post - colonial Hong Kong and Mainland China. The position of red and white on the flag symbolizes the " one country two systems " political principle applied to the region. The stylized rendering of the " Bauhinia blakeana " flower, a flower discovered in Hong Kong, is meant to serve as a harmonizing symbol for this dichotomy. The five stars of the Chinese national flag are replicated on the petals of the flower. The Chinese name of " Bauhinia × blakeana " is most commonly rendered as " [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] ", but is often shortened to [UNK] [UNK] / [UNK] [UNK] in official uses since " [UNK] " ( " yáng " ) means " foreign " in Chinese, notwithstanding [UNK] [UNK] / [UNK] [UNK] refers to another genus called " Cercis ".

However, " two " tangent lines can be drawn to a circle from a point P outside of the circle. The geometrical figure of a circle and both tangent lines likewise has a reflection symmetry about the radial axis joining P to the center point O of the circle. Thus the lengths of the segments from P to the two tangent points are equal. By the secant - tangent theorem, the @ @ square @ @ of this tangent length equals the power of the point P in the circle " C ".

trunk	The oldest known mention of the settlement dates back to 965. Its name is of Slavic origin, and comes from the word " pień ", which means " @ @ trunk @ @ ". It was included in the early Polish state by first Polish King Bolesław I the Brave and in the 11th century it passed to the Duchy of Bohemia, which was elevated to a kingdom in 1198. The Upper Lusatian lords of Penzig ( " von Penzig " ) are first recorded in 1241. Besides Pieńsk the family held a number of other towns and territories on both banks of the Lusatian Neisse river. In 1250 a castle was built. In 1321 local Polish Duke Henry I of Jawor confirmed the rights of the Penzig family to the settlement. From the 14th century until 1815 at various times Pieńsk was under the rule of local Polish dukes of the Piast dynasty, kings of Bohemia, Hungary, electors of Saxony and kings of Poland. In 1491 the city of Görlitz purchased the " Penziger Heide " ( parts of the territory of Penzig ) and combined it as " Görlitzer Heide " with its own communal territory.	tree trunk	tree trunk	8716-0	tree trunk	tree trunk	The main stem of a tree; usually covered with bark; the bole is usually the part that is commercially useful for lumber

trunk	A notable specimen of " Cupressus cashmeriana " is situated in front of the palace on Isola Madre, the largest of the Borromean Islands in Lake Maggiore. The seeds for the tree were sent back from the Himalayan region by a correspondent of the Borromeo family, William B. Pentland, in June 1862. By 1915, the Isola Madre specimen was noted as the best in Northern Italy and measured 60ft. high, 6ft. in girth, its branches covering an area of over 35 paces in circumference. In 2006, a fierce storm on the night of 28 June knocked the tree down, necessitating a multi - disciplinary effort to save it.

trunk	The river Lippe appears as a two - tier water course : Upstream, eastward of the city of Hamm / Lippborg, the catchment is more rural. Downstream of Hamm settlements and industrial impacts characterize the situation. Preconditions for the industrialization started with the construction of the Cologne - Minden @ @ trunk @ @ line in the 1840s that connected the river Rhine settlements like Cologne with harbours and trade at the river Weser and on this route with Lippe towns, too. Moreover, this railway supported the coal and steel industry development in the whole northern Ruhr region. The hard coal mining that started in the middle of the 19th century in the Emscher catchment area developed in the following decades direction north. In the Lippe catchment area from the 1860s on first problems from mining subsidence and drainage of polluted water appeared. Villages and towns located at the Lippe and its tributary Seseke ( Werl, Unna, Hamm, Bönen, Kamen, Bergkamen, Lünen and Dortmund ) expanded quickly with the establishing of hard coal mines between 1856 and World War I. The industrialization caused huge water quality problems in the Lippe, its tributaries and the settlements ; therefore first in 1913 the Sesekegenossenschaft and later in 1926 the Lippeverband as public water boards ( “ Wasserwirtschaftsverbände ” ) were established.	main transportation line	trunk line	8716-2	main transportation line	trunk line/trunk road	The main stem of a tree; usually covered with bark; the bole is usually the part that is commercially useful for lumber

trunk	On day 28, areas of tissue in the heart tube begin to expand inwards ; after about two weeks, these expansions, the membranous " septum primum " and the muscular " endocardial cushions ", fuse to form the four chambers of the heart. A failure to fuse properly will result in a defect that may allow blood to leak between chambers. After this happens, cells which have migrated from the neural crest begin to divide the bulbus cordis, the main outflow tract is divided in two by the growth a spiraling septum, becoming the great vessels — the ascending segment of the aorta and the pulmonary @ @ trunk @ @. If the separation is incomplete, the result is a " persistent truncus arteriosis ". The vessels may be reversed ( " transposition of the great vessels " ). The two halves of the split tract must migrate into the correct positions over the appropriate ventricles. A failure may result in some blood flowing into the wrong vessel ( " e. g. " overriding aorta ). The four - chambered heart and the great vessels have features required for fetal growth. The lungs are unexpanded and cannot accommodate the full circulatory volume. Two structures exist to shunt blood flow away from the lungs. Cells in part of the septum primum die creating a hole while muscle cells, the " septum secundum ", grow along the right atrial side the septum primum, except for one region, leaving a gap through which blood can pass from the right artium to the left atrium, the foramen ovale. A small vessel, the " ductus arteriosus " allows blood from the pulmonary artery to pass to the aorta.	tube-like main organ	tube-like main organ	8716-3	torso/tube-like main organ	torso	The body excluding the head and neck and limbs

trunk	 In the summer of 1896, aspiring post Robert Frost ( 1874 – 1963 ) and his wife Elinor spent a belated honeymoon in a rented cottage near the Suncook River in Allenstown. Carl Burell, a high school friend and avid naturalist, was foreman at the Moulton box shop at Buck Street dam. Botany walks with Burell awakened Frost to the natural world, coloring his later writings. Frost recalled these walks in'The Quest of the Orchis'( 1901 ). Burell's 1896 injury in a mill accident inspired Frost's poem,'The Self - Seeker '.  " A bridge was built at'Buck Street,'by the 1750s. Natural falls were dammed to power saw and grist mills before 1767. The 19th c. added a water - powered fulling mill for cleansing wool cloth by 1813, a bedstead shop by 1845, a spoke shop in the 1850s and twine mills. By the 1890s, the dams powered Charles Fisher's axe handle factory and Reuben C. Moulton's box and @ @ trunk @ @ shop.

The base model Sport Coupe was still available with the same general body panels that it had since 1981, but featured new " aero " side mirrors similar to those on Camaros and Chevrolet Corvette of the 1980s. New for the 1986 model year was a Luxury Sport model that had a revised front fascia, new " aero " side mirrors, and an updated sleek - looking rear fascia. The LS front fascia included " Euro " headlights with removable bulbs in a glass composite headlamp housing, versus the smaller sealed beam glass headlights of previous years. The rear bumper of the LS no longer had a " notch " between the bumper and @ @ trunk @ @, and the taillights wrapped around so that they were visible from the sides of the car. The Super Sport model for 1986 incorporated the " aero " mirrors, yet still utilized the prior year's styling for the rear bumper. Also new this year was the Aerocoupe model. The Aerocoupe was created by modifications to the Super Sport body, including a more deeply sloped rear window and a shorter trunk lid sporting a spoiler that lay more flat than previous Super Sports. Only 200 Aerocoupes were sold to the public, which happened to be the exact number NASCAR officials required for road model features to be incorporated into the racing cars. 1986 Monte Carlo SS Aerocoupe Registry & Information	large container	car's compartment	8716-1	large container	car's compartment/luggage	The main stem of a tree; usually covered with bark; the bole is usually the part that is commercially useful for lumber

trunk	According to a study showing the different relationships between limbs of the body and coordination in infants, genetic components have a huge impact on motor development ( Piek, Gasson, Barrett, & Case ( 2002 ) ). Intra - limb correlations, like the strong relationship and distance between hip and knee joints, were studied and proved to affect the way an infant will walk. There are also bigger genetic factors like the tendency to use the left or right side of the body more, predicting the dominant hand early. Sample t - tests proved that there was a significant difference between both sides at 18 weeks for girls and the right side was considered to be more dominant ( Piek et al. ( 2002 ) ). Some factors, like the fact that boys tend to have larger and longer arms are biological constraints that we cannot control, yet have an influence for example, on when an infant will reach sufficiently. Overall, there are sociological factors and genetic factors that influence motor development. Nutrition and exercise also determine strength and therefore the ease and accuracy with which a body part can be moved. Flexibility is also affected by nutrition and exercise as well. It has also been shown that the frontal lobe develops posterio - anteriorally ( from back to front ). This is significant in motor development because the hind portion of the frontal lobe is known to control motor functions. This form of development is known as " Portional Development " and explains why motor functions develop relatively quickly during typical childhood development, while logic, which is controlled by the middle and front portions of the frontal lobe, usually will not develop until late childhood and early adolescence. Opportunities to carry out movements help establish the abilities to flex ( move toward the @ @ trunk @ @ ) and extend body parts, both capacities are necessary for good motor ability. Skilled voluntary movements such as passing objects from hand to hand develop as a result of practice and learning. Mastery Climate is a suggested successful learning environment for children to promote motor skills by their own motivation. This promotes participation and active learning in children, which according to Piaget's theory of cognitive development is extremely important in early childhood rule.	torso	torso	8716-3	torso/tube-like main organ	torso	The body excluding the head and neck and limbs

Turner to determine what improvements were needed in the city's public transport system. The Great Depression resulted in soaring costs, and the expansion became unmanageable, so it was not built along with the other three IND @ @ trunk @ @ lines. Construction on the first phase of the IND was already behind schedule, and the city and state were no longer able to provide funding. A scaled - down proposal including a turnoff at 34th Street and a connection crosstown was postponed in 1931. Further revision of the plan and more studies followed. By 1939, construction had been postponed indefinitely, and Second Avenue was relegated to " proposed " status. The 1939 plan for subway expansion took the line not only into the Bronx ( by now as a single line to Throggs Neck ) but also south into Brooklyn, connecting to the stub of the IND Fulton Street Line at Court Street. Construction of the line resumed in 1972 but was ended during the 1975 fiscal crisis, and work was again restarted in 2007.	main transportation line	trunk line	8716-2	main transportation line	trunk line/trunk road	The main stem of a tree; usually covered with bark; the bole is usually the part that is commercially useful for lumber

The " Dunmore " was armed with 6 - pound cannons and fired back without hitting anything. Meanwhile, the " Dunmore " kept getting hit by 18 - pound shot. After the boatswain was killed and several men wounded, the demoralized crew flinched from the guns. Since there was no wind to propel the ship, Dunmore ordered the anchor cable cut and had the flagship towed out of range. While the 18 - pounders hammered the flagship, the 9 - pounders took Fort Hamond and the loyalist camp under accurate fire. At first the fort fired back, but its guns were silenced by the bombardment. Startled by the attack, the loyalist ships within range slipped their anchor cables and had their boats tow them out of range. After about two hours, the commander of the 18 - pounders, Captain Dohickey Arundel decided to fire his experimental wooden mortar. The mortar blew up at the first shot, killing Arundel, making him the only patriot casualty of the action. This accident led to a temporary cease fire. By the time firing resumed in the afternoon, there were very few targets. The loyalist ships withdrew out of range farther into the bay, while Fort Hamond and the loyalist camp were abandoned. The patriots claimed that the " Dunmore " was fatally damaged, but Hamond reported that the ship's injuries were not serious, despite numerous hits.

yard	Another coach sometimes credited with popularizing the overhead spiral pass in 1906 is former Princeton All - American " Bosey " Reiter. Reiter claimed to have invented the overhead spiral pass while playing professional football as a player - coach for Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics of the original National Football League ( 1902 ). While playing for the Athletics, Reiter was a teammate of Hawley Pierce, a former star for the Carlisle Indian School. Pierce, a Native American, taught Reiter to throw an underhand spiral pass, but Reiter had short arms and was unable to throw for distance from an underhand delivery. Accordingly, Reiter began working on an overhand spiral pass. Reiter recalled trying to imitate the motion of a baseball catcher throwing to second base. After practice and experimentation, Reiter " discovered he could get greater distance and accuracy throwing that way. " In 1906, Reiter was the head coach at Wesleyan University. In the opening game of the 1906 season against Yale, Reiter's quarterback Sammy Moore completed a forward pass to Irvin van Tassell for a thirty - @ @ yard @ @ gain. " The New York Times " called it " the prettiest play of the day ", as Wesleyan's quarterback " deftly passed the ball past the whole Yale team to his mate Van Tassel. " Van Tassel later described the historic play to the United Press : " I was the right halfback, and on this formation played one yard back of our right tackle. The quarterback, Sam Moore, took the ball from center and faded eight or 10 yards back of our line. Our two ends angled down the field toward the sidelines as a decoy, and I slipped through the strong side of our line straight down the center and past the secondary defense. The pass worked perfectly. However, the quarterback coming up fast nailed me as I caught it. This brought the ball well into Yale territory, about the 20 - yard line. " The football season opened for most schools during the first week of October, and the impact of the forward pass was immediate :	unit	unit	3723-0	unit	unit	A unit of length equal to 3 feet; defined as 91.44 centimeters; originally taken to be the average length of a stride

The " Upper Village " had at its disposal the Gothic Saint Lawrence's Chapel ( " Kapelle St. Laurentius " ), first mentioned in 1240, which was raised to a branch church. In the 14th century it was joined by Saint Anthony's Chapel ( " Kapelle St. Antonius " ) at the graveyard in the " Lower Village " and the Infirmary @ @ Yard @ @ Chapel of Mary Magdalene ( " Spitalhof - Kapelle St. Maria Magdalena " ) in the " Upper Village ".
